<p>“Stand back there! Move aside! Good heavens!
Can’t you see the woman will die if you press about her in
this way?”</p>

<p>The speaker bent over the lifeless form as he uttered
these words, and tried once more to pour a little stimulant
between the pallid lips. The scene was one of indescribable
confusion. A collision had occurred between the
Chesterham express and a goods train, just a short distance
from Chesterham Junction. Five of the carriages
were wrecked. Fortunately, three were empty; and the
other two contained only three passengers—a man, who,
with his arm bound up, was already starting to walk to
the town; a boy, badly cut about the head, leaning, pale
and faint, on a portion of the broken woodwork; and,
lastly, a woman, who lay motionless on the bank, a thick
shawl spread between her and the cold, damp earth. On
discovery, she had been removed from the <i>débris</i>, laid on
the bank, and forgotten in the excitement and terror.
The rest of the passengers had sustained only a severe
shaking and bruises; and loud were their grumblings and
expressions of self-sympathy as they clustered together
on the bank, shivering in the gray autumn mist. A doctor,
who had been summoned from Chesterham, ran his
eye over the assembled people, strapped up the boy’s head,
and skillfully set the broken arm of the man. It was
while doing this that his glance fell on the prostrate form
lying on the grass; and the sight of the pale, bloodless
face immediately brought a frown to his brow.</p>

<p>“What is the matter here?” he asked a passing porter.</p>

<p>“Lady in a faint, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>The doctor fastened the last bandage, and, with hurried
steps, approached the woman. A crowd followed him,
and gathered round so closely as to cause him to request
them to “stand back.” His words produced the desired
effect, and the bystanders moved away and watched, with
breathless interest, his fruitless efforts to restore animation.</p>

<p>The frown darkened on the doctor’s brow; there was
something more than an ordinary faint here. He raised
the woman’s head for another trial, and the mass of red-gold
hair, already loosened, fell in glorious waves round
the beautiful, pale face, bringing a murmur of admiration
from the beholders. The sudden action caused one
limp, cold hand to fall against the doctor’s warm one,
and at the contact he shuddered. He raised the heavily-fringed
eyelids, gave one look, then gently laid the
woman’s head down again, and reverently covered her
face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“I can do nothing,” he said, tersely, as if speaking to
himself; “she is dead!”</p>

<p>The crowd drew back involuntarily; some hid their
faces, while others gazed at the slight form in its dark-brown
dress as if they doubted the truth of his statement.
Suddenly, while the doctor stood thoughtfully drawing
on his gloves, one of the porters appeared in the crowd.
He held a child in his arms—such a pretty child—with
hair that matched the red-gold masses of the lifeless form
on the bank, eyes that shone like sapphire stars from beneath
her curling lashes, and a skin of cream white, with
no warmth of color in the face, save that of the small, red
lips. She was dressed in a little gray coat, all covered
now with dust; in her tiny hands she clasped a piece of
broken woodwork, holding it as though it were a treasure,
and she glanced round at the bystanders with an air
of childish piquancy and assurance.</p>

<p>“Whose child is this?” inquired the porter, looking
from one to another.</p>

<p>There was a pause; no one spoke; no one owned her.
The porter’s honest face grew troubled.</p>

<p>“Where does she come from?” asked the doctor,
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“We have just picked her from under the roof of a
second-class carriage,” the porter explained. “We were
turning it over—you see, sir, it fell some distance from
the rest of the carriage—and when we lifted it we found
this mite a-singing to herself and nursing her dolly, as
she calls this piece of wood. It’s by Heaven’s mercy she
ain’t been smashed to bits; but she ain’t got not even a
bruise. She must belong to some one,” he added, looking
round again.</p>

<p>A lady in the crowd here stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Give her to me,” she said, kindly. “Perhaps she was
traveling alone; if so, that will be explained, no doubt, by
a letter or something.”</p>

<p>But the child clung to the porter, her pretty brows
puckered, her red lips quivering.</p>

<p>“Mammie!” she cried, plaintively. “I wants my
mammie!”</p>

<p>The doctor turned and looked at the child, and at that
instant she suddenly wriggled and twisted herself from
the porter’s arms to the ground, and, running to the
silent form lying on the bank, crouched down and
clutched a bit of the brown dress in her hands.</p>

<p>“Mammie,” she said, confidently, looking round with
her great, blue eyes on the circle of faces, all of which
expressed horror, pity and sadness; “Mardie’s mammie!”</p>

<p>The doctor stooped, drew back the handkerchief, and
glanced from the living to the dead.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, abruptly; “this is her mother. Heaven
have mercy on her, poor little soul!”</p>

<p>The lady who had come forward went up to the child,
her eyes filled with tears. She loosened the dress from
the small fingers.</p>

<p>“Mardie must be good,” she said, tenderly, “and not
wake her mammie. Mammie has gone to sleep.”</p>

<p>The child looked at the still form, the covered face.</p>

<p>“Mammie seep,” she repeated; “Mardie no peak,
mammie—be good,” and she lowered her voice to a whisper
and repeated, “be good.” She suffered herself to be
lifted in the kind, motherly arms, and pressed her bit
of wood closer to her, humming in a low voice.</p>

<p>“We must find out who she is,” the doctor said, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
eyes wandering again and again to the dead woman.
“She must be carried to the town; there will be an inquest.”</p>

<p>A passenger at this moment pointed to some vehicles
coming toward them. They could not drive close to the
spot, as a plowed field stretched between the railway and
the road, and one by one the group dispersed, all stopping
to pat the child’s face and speak to her. The doctor gave
some orders to the porter who had found the child, and a
litter, formed of a broken carriage door, was hastily improvised.
As the crowd withdrew, he knelt down by the
dead woman, and, with reverent hands, searched in the
pockets for some clew. He drew out a purse, shabby
and small, and, opening this, found only a few shillings
and a railway ticket, a second-class return from Euston
to Chesterham. In an inner recess of the purse there
was a folded paper, which disclosed a curl of ruddy-gold
hair when opened, and on which was written:
“Baby Margery’s hair, August 19th.”</p>

<p>The doctor carefully replaced it. A key and a tiny,
old-fashioned worthless locket were the remainder of the
contents. He checked a little sigh as he closed the purse,
and then proceeded to search further. A pocket
handkerchief, with the letter “M” in one corner, and a
pair of dogskin gloves, worn and neatly mended, were
the next objects, and one letter, which—after replacing
the gloves and handkerchief—he opened hurriedly. The
lady, still holding the child in her arms, watched him anxiously.
The envelope, which was already broken, was
addressed to “M., care of Post Office, Newtown, Middlesex.”
The doctor unfolded the note. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mrs. Huntley will engage “M.” if proper references are forwarded.
Mrs. Huntley would require “M.” to begin her duties
as maid, should her references prove satisfactory, as soon as
possible. “M.’s” statement that she speaks French and German
fluently has induced Mrs. Huntley to reconsider the question of
salary. She will now give “M.” twenty-five pounds per annum,
for which sum “M.” must undertake to converse daily with Mr.
Huntley’s daughter in French and German, in addition to her
duties as maid. Mrs. Huntley desires that “M.” will send her
real name by return of post.</p>

<p>Upton Manor, near Liddlefield, Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The doctor handed the note to the lady, who read it
through quickly.</p>

<p>“That does not give much information,” he observed,
rising from his knees.</p>

<p>“Dated yesterday—received this morning. We must
telegraph to this Mrs. Huntley; who knows?—the poor
creature may have sent her references, with her full
name, before starting from London.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right; we must do that. But what is
to become of the child? Are you staying here for long,
madam?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the lady; “I had intended to travel
straight on to the North. But I shall remain in Chesterham
for the night, and continue my journey to-morrow.
I wish I could delay it longer; but, unfortunately, my
son is ill in Edinburgh, and I must get to him as soon
as possible. However, I will take care of this poor little
mite to-night. I hope by the morning we shall have discovered
her friends and relations.”</p>

<p>“If you will do that,” said the doctor, “I will see to
the mother. I must have the body carried to the infirmary.”</p>

<p>He beckoned, as he spoke, to the porter, who was
standing at a little distance, talking to the crowd of
natives who had arrived to clear the line, and the dead
woman was lifted on to the litter, and covered with a rug
belonging to the lady who had taken charge of the child.
She watched the proceedings with a feeling of unspeakable
sadness, and, as the melancholy burden was carried
toward one of the cabs, she clasped the child closer to her
breast, and tears stole down her cheeks.</p>

<p>The baby, cooing to her strange doll, looked up as
they moved across the field. She put up one little hand
and rubbed away a tear from the motherly face.</p>

<p>“No kye,” she said, in her pretty, lisping fashion.
“Mardie dood—she no kye.”</p>

<p>The lady kissed the small lips.</p>

<p>“Mardie is a sweet angel,” she whispered; “and now
she shall come with me to a pretty place and have some
nice dinner.”</p>

<p>“Din-din,” said the child, nodding her head with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
wealth of red-gold curls. “Mardie ’ungry. Mammie a
din-din, too?”</p>

<p>The lady shivered.</p>

<p>“Yes, mammie will go to a pretty place, too,” she answered
hurriedly.</p>

<p>When they reached the cab, the doctor came up to
them.</p>

<p>“If you will allow me to suggest, The Plow is the best
hotel. I would come with you, but I must drive straight
to the infirmary. Give me the child for a moment while
you get in. She has lost her hat, poor little thing; but
the town is not far off, and the best place for her will be
in bed.”</p>

<p>Mardie went willingly to the doctor’s arms. She prattled
to him about the “din-din” and “mammie,” but
much was unintelligible to him. She did not ask for her
mother or seem strange. “Mammie a seep,” she asserted
several times, in a whisper; and she was content with
the two kind beings whose hearts were heavy with pain
as they thought of the long, dreary path she must tread
henceforth without a touch from the loving hands, or a
word from the tender voice she knew so well.</p>

<p>“There, madam,” and the doctor placed the small,
gray-clad form in the cab. “This poor little mite cannot
thank you herself; but, if you will allow me, in humanity’s
name to offer you gratitude——”</p>

<p>The lady stopped him.</p>

<p>“I have done no more than my duty. I thank you, sir,
for your courtesy. Will you kindly let me know as early
as possible the results of your telegram? I will go to
the Plow; my name is Graham.”</p>

<p>“And mine Scott. I will certainly let you know the
instant I receive any intelligence. Something must be
done with this child; but that is for to-morrow’s consideration.
She is safe in your hands for to-night.”</p>

<p>Dr. Scott raised his hat, and the cab started along the
country lane toward Chesterham. Mrs. Graham drew
Mardie on to her knee, and tried to chat to the child;
but her whole nervous system was so shattered by the
events of the past hour that the effort was vain.</p>

<p>Chesterham was a large manufacturing town. The
news of the collision had spread rapidly, and, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the November dusk was closing in, crowds were thronging
to the scene of the disaster. Mrs. Graham leaned
back in a corner to escape the eager eyes, for she knew
the story of the young mother’s death would be known by
now, and her natural refinement and delicacy shrunk from
vulgar curiosity and hysterical excitement. The cab soon
rattled into Chesterham, and, after a short journey
through the lamp-lighted streets, stopped before the door
of The Plow. Mardie was handed out to a pretty-faced
chambermaid, whose bright cap ribbon immediately
claimed the child’s attention, and Mrs. Graham followed
slowly and wearily up the stairs, feeling her strength go
at every step. The babyish voice and shrill peals of
laughter echoed in her ears as the wail of future grief;
her eyes were fixed on the small form, but her thoughts
were with the dead young mother.</p>

<p>She dismissed the maid when she reached her room,
and, drawing Mardie to her, began to loosen the gray
coat, which bore traces of dainty design beneath the dust
and dirt. For the first time the child seemed to feel her
loss.</p>

<p>“Mammie undress Mardie,” she said, putting up one
little hand. “Mammie seep now, but wake soon.”</p>

<p>“Mammie would like Mardie to take off her coat like
a good girl,” Mrs. Graham replied, feeling instinctively
that the youthful mind grasped already the meaning of
love and duty.</p>

<p>The child dropped her hand and nodded her head, then
submitted to have the coat removed. She was neatly
dressed in a dark-red cashmere frock, made loose like a
blouse; she wore a tiny thread of gold round her neck,
with a little heart-shaped pendant suspended. Mrs.
Graham took it in her hand, eagerly hoping to find some
clew; but, on turning it, her eyes rested on a miniature
of the mother’s lovely face.</p>

<p>“Mardie’s mammie,” exclaimed the child, taking it
and kissing it—“dear mammie!”—then, with infantile
changeableness, she rushed with a little shriek to the
door, where a kitten had just appeared, and with
great delight picked up the downy little creature and
caressed it.</p>

<p>The advent of dinner soon attracted her attention, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
she prattled away merrily in her baby language while the
dishes were carried in. Mrs. Graham forced herself to
talk to the child, and tried to divert her mind from its
gloomy thoughts by devoting herself to the task of tending
the little one. She was not a young woman, and the
events of the day had proved almost too much for her
nervous system; but with true unselfishness she tried to
forget her own troubles in ministering to the tiny atom
of humanity thrown so cruelly upon the world’s ocean,
with mayhap no haven or port of love and affection to
look to.</p>

<p>She lifted Mardie on to a chair, and was about to
give her some food, when the door opened, and, looking
up in surprise, she saw a lady, young and handsome,
attired in a riding habit, enter the room.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p>“I must apologize for this intrusion,” began the
stranger, as she closed the door; “but my errand, I trust,
will excuse me.”</p>

<p>“What may I do for you?” asked Mrs. Graham, rising.</p>

<p>“Let me introduce myself,” said the young lady, with
a pretty smile. “I am Lady Coningham, wife of Sir
Hubert Coningham, of the Weald, Hurstley, a village
about three miles out.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham bowed.</p>

<p>“I heard of the terrible accident while returning from
a long run, and I rode over immediately to make inquiries.
I have learned everything.” She stopped for
an instant, and then asked: “Is that the child?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mrs. Graham, briefly.</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” murmured Lady Coningham, involuntarily.
She moved forward and bent over the child,
stroking back the rich, golden-red curls. “Poor wee
thing! How pretty she is!”</p>

<p>Mardie smiled and showed her pearly teeth as she
rapped her spoon impatiently on the table.</p>

<p>“Din-din,” she cried, eagerly; “Mardie so ’ungry!”</p>

<p>Lady Coningham stood by while Mrs. Graham prepared
the child’s meal. She said nothing, but two tears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
rolled down her cheeks and fell upon her well-gloved
hand. As soon as the child was well started, she turned
and motioned Mrs. Graham to the fireplace.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me anything about her?” she asked,
quickly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham shook her head.</p>

<p>“We have no idea,” she answered; then she spoke of
the letter and the doctor’s intention of telegraphing to
Mrs. Huntley.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, that will be best. My object in coming
here, Mrs. Graham, was to speak about the child. I met
Dr. Scott, who told me, briefly, of the mother’s death and
your kindness; and I hurried here to see what I could
do. Sir Hubert is one of the magistrates; therefore, as
his wife, I consider it my duty to take up the case. Perhaps
my efforts will not be required for long—I sincerely
hope not—it will be a sad lookout for this baby if we cannot
find her friends.”</p>

<p>“It is the merest chance,” Mrs. Graham observed.
“This lady in Yorkshire may have received the name and
references. I earnestly trust she has.”</p>

<p>“If not, we must consider what to do with her,” said
Lady Coningham. “I would give everything I possess
to be able to carry her home with me; but”—she sighed a
little—“that is out of the question.”</p>

<p>“You have children?” inquired Mrs. Graham, gently,
attracted by the other’s sweet expression.</p>

<p>“No,” Lady Coningham answered, slowly. “I had one
once, but—but it is gone.” She bent to kiss Mardie’s
soft little cheek as she spoke, and again tears welled into
her eyes.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have come,” said Mrs. Graham, after
a pause, “for it would have gone to my heart to leave the
child without some kind hand to minister to it occasionally.
I must go North to-morrow; but I feel now that,
should the worst happen and we find no clue, you will
care for this poor little flower.”</p>

<p>“I will do all in my power for her,” returned the
younger woman; “but do not let me keep you from your
dinner—indeed, you must want it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham rose and seated herself at the table. She
felt weak and faint, but eating was almost an impossibility.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Mardie, her food finished, put her hands together
and whispered a grace, then wriggled down from
her chair and went to the fire.</p>

<p>“She must go to bed,” said Mrs. Graham, rising again
and ringing the bell; “she is growing tired now.”</p>

<p>The words were quickly verified, for the little head
suddenly began to droop, and the beautiful eyes to grow
misty and sleepy; but, as Lady Coningham, who had
hurriedly removed her gloves, knelt and began to unbutton
her frock, the little child pushed her away and
looked round with a sudden quick feeling of fear and
strangeness.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mardie’s mammie—where a mammie?” she
murmured.</p>

<p>“Mammie is asleep,” said Mrs. Graham, soothingly,
dreading a fit of terror.</p>

<p>“Mammie seep? Mardie want a mammie. Mammie
come a Mardie, come a Mardie!”</p>

<p>She ran to the door of the room and tried to reach
the handle. Lady Coningham picked her up.</p>

<p>“If Mardie will be a very good little girl, she shall
have some goodies—such pretty goodies. See, here
comes Mardie’s bath! She is going to be such a clean
little girl.”</p>

<p>Mardie sat still, but her small hands were clasped together,
and her little chest heaved with sobs. Then, as
the bath was put before the fire, and, looking from one
to the other, she could see nowhere the sweet, tender
face that had smiled on her every day of her young
recollection, she burst into a tempest of tears, and,
struggling from Lady Coningham’s hold, ran wildly
round the room in a paroxysm of fear, calling for her
“mammie.”</p>

<p>For several minutes their coaxing tenderness was in
vain; but after a while the maid succeeded in attracting
her attention with a gaudily-painted sugar parrot, which
she had purchased at a confectioner’s shop near by. The
tears were all spent, nothing but sobs remained, and the
parrot came as a welcome bright spot in her small world
of grief.</p>

<p>“Pitty—pitty,” she murmured, clasping it to her breast
and hugging it. Then she grew so sleepy that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
scarcely conscious of their hands removing her clothes,
and her head drooped like a tired flower as they put on a
nightgown borrowed from the landlady. She needed no
lullaby to coax her to slumber now, and was lost in
dreamland as the maid carried her gently into the bedroom.</p>

<p>Lady Coningham stood and gazed, as if held by some
magnetic power, at the tiny face pressing the pillow, at
the clusters of red-gold curls falling in such rich profusion
around it. She was lost in the memory of the
brief joy that had come to her only two short years before,
and lived once again in the unspeakable happiness
of motherhood.</p>

<p>The sound of a deep voice broke her musings, and,
stealing softly from the bed, she entered the sitting-room
and gave her hand to Dr. Scott.</p>

<p>“What news?” she asked, hurriedly.</p>

<p>Dr. Scott handed her a telegram, then seated himself
by the table, leaning his head on his hand.</p>

<p>Lady Coningham hastily read the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From Mrs. Huntley, Upton Manor, Liddlefield, to Dr. Scott,
Chesterham:—Am distressed to hear of accident and the poor
woman’s death. I can give you no information, as I have received
no reply to my last letter to “M.” Pray let me know if I
can be of any pecuniary assistance.</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Coningham put down the paper quietly.</p>

<p>“What is to be done now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I have telegraphed to Newtown,” replied Dr. Scott,
looking up, “to the post office there, but, as yet, have received
no reply. They may know something, but I can
not help thinking the poor creature had some reason for
secrecy, and I am doubtful as to success.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham was reclining wearily in an armchair by
the fire. She spoke now as the doctor finished.</p>

<p>“I wish from my heart I could take the child, but it is
out of the question, at any rate just now. My son is
studying at Edinburgh University; he unfortunately
caught a severe cold, and is now prostrate with rheumatic
fever. My every moment will be with him; but,
if you will place the poor mite with some kind people for
a time, Lady Coningham, I will add my share to the expense,
though frankly I am not by any means wealthy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“I know of a person,” began the doctor; but Lady
Coningham broke in eagerly:</p>

<p>“I will take her to Hurstley. There is a poor young
woman, the wife of one of my gardeners, almost heart-broken
through the death of her baby. Her cottage is
not far from the Weald. I pass it every day in my rides,
and I could see the child very often. Let her come there
to-morrow before you start. I will see Mrs. Morris to-night
as I go home.”</p>

<p>“That seems an excellent plan,” agreed the elder
woman—“at all events, for a time; but we must leave no
stone unturned to find her relations.”</p>

<p>“Will Sir Hubert like the arrangement, your ladyship?”
asked Dr. Scott, as he rose to depart.</p>

<p>Lady Coningham’s face flushed slightly.</p>

<p>“I will make it all right,” she replied, though with a
little constraint. “Fortunately, Morris is a favorite with
him. But now I must go; it is very late, and I have a
long ride. Lest we should not meet again before you
start, Mrs. Graham, let me say now how pleased I am to
have made your acquaintance, though the introduction
has been a sad one. I will let you know early in the
morning, Dr. Scott, if I have succeeded; and may I ask
you to send the child over?”</p>

<p>The doctor bowed, and opened the door.</p>

<p>“I will come down and assist you to mount. Your
groom is with you, I trust?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” Lady Coningham smiled another farewell
to Mrs. Graham, and was passing out, when a thought
struck her. “Suppose,” she said hurriedly, “suppose I
cannot do this, what will become of the child?”</p>

<p>“She must go to the workhouse,” replied Dr. Scott,
gloomily; “my hands are too full already, as your ladyship
knows, and there is no other alternative.”</p>

<p>Lady Coningham could not repress a shudder.</p>

<p>“That must never be,” she said decidedly. “I must
arrange with Morris. Many thanks. Good-by!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham rose early the next morning. Her sleep
had been troubled and restless; but the child had never
moved, and still slept on placidly as she dressed herself
quietly. Dr. Scott was announced about half past eight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and his face showed that he had gained no further information.</p>

<p>“The post office can give me no clew,” he said.
“They recollect the woman ‘M.,’ and describe her accurately;
but she received no letters save three addressed to
her initial; consequently we are just where we were.
Lady Coningham has sent her groom to say that Mrs.
Morris will receive the child, so when she is dressed I
had better take her over there myself.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham assented with a sigh, and then rang for
the maid to assist her in preparing Margery for the journey.
The little one was very good; she submitted to her
bath in brightness, and only now and then would turn
her head to look for her mother. Already she seemed
to know Mrs. Graham, and raised her lips many times to
be kissed, her childish affection sending a pang of pain
through the woman’s heart. At last all was ready; the
little gray coat well brushed and repaired, was donned, a
silk handkerchief tied over the red gold curls, and the beloved
parrot clutched in a tight embrace. Mrs. Graham
knelt for one brief moment by the small form, and a
silent prayer went up to Heaven for mercy and protection;
then she led the child to the doctor.</p>

<p>“I will write from Edinburgh,” she said hurriedly;
“perhaps, after all, I shall be able to manage something
in the future; and here”—handing two sovereigns to the
doctor—“is my small share toward present expenses.
When will the inquest be?”</p>

<p>“To-day,” returned Dr. Scott, picking Margery up in
his arms.</p>

<p>“And she will be buried where?” again asked Mrs.
Graham quickly.</p>

<p>“It must be a pauper’s funeral,” he answered, sadly;
“any other would cost too much.”</p>

<p>“Can we not get up a subscription? The railway
company should give something. It seems so dreadful
that she should be buried in a pauper’s grave, with no
stone above her.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best to prevent it,” Dr. Scott said,
kindly. “Your suggestion about the railway is good,
and I will communicate with the directors to-day.
Whatever happens in the future, you, madame, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
acted nobly, and this child owes you a debt of gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I wish I could keep her with me always!” Mrs.
Graham responded, kissing the little cheek once more.
“I must say good-by now. I will write to you in a day
or two. Will you let me know if any news reaches you,
and where you bury the poor mother?”</p>

<p>“I will,” answered the doctor; then he turned away
and carried the child, still happy and unconscious of her
terrible loss, down the stairs, to his trap; and, taking the
reins, he drove rapidly through the town to the village of
Hurstley.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p>“Stuart, where are you going?”</p>

<p>The question was put in a cold, sharp voice, and came
from a lady sitting at her writing-desk in a spacious window-recess
overlooking extensive grounds. She was a
handsome woman, with rather massive features and a
profusion of dark-brown hair artistically arranged. Her
eyes, of a light green-gray shade, were fixed at this
moment on a young man standing in an easy, graceful
attitude outside the French window.</p>

<p>“Going, mother?” he responded. “Nowhere in particular.
Do you want me?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie examined her firm white hands for one
brief second.</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten what to-day is?” she asked,
quietly.</p>

<p>The young man pondered, puckered his handsome
brows, and pretended to be lost in doubt.</p>

<p>“I really forget,” he answered, after a while, looking
up with a mischievous twinkle in his brown eyes.
“Thursday, I believe; but you have your almanac close
to your hand, mother.”</p>

<p>“This is Thursday, the twenty-second of July, Stuart,”
observed Mrs. Crosbie, putting down her pen and looking
fixedly at her son. “And this afternoon your Aunt
Clara and Cousin Vane will arrive, and you are expected
to meet them at Chesterham station.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“By Jove,” exclaimed Stuart, with a soft whistle, “I
had clean forgotten them!” He pushed his hands into
his tennis-coat pockets and regarded his shoes with almost
a real pucker on his brow. “What time are they
due?” he asked, after a brief silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie took up a letter and read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We shall arrive at Chesterham by the twelve express from
Euston, reaching the junction about six-thirty. Pray let somebody
meet us.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I call that cool,” observed the young man shortly.
“But I suppose Aunt Clara cannot do a thing for herself.
However, it need not entail my going; she only
says ‘somebody,’ and I am nobody.”</p>

<p>“Your father will expect his sister to be treated with
respect,” was his mother’s icy reply.</p>

<p>“And I trust he will not be disappointed,” responded
Stuart; “but to trudge to Chesterham in this heat will
be enough to roast a fellow.”</p>

<p>“I have ordered the barouche,” Mrs. Crosbie told him.
“Vane must lean back comfortably—she is so delicate.”</p>

<p>Stuart Crosbie buried his toe in the well-kept lawn and
made no answer to this. His mother watched him
keenly, though he was unaware of her scrutiny.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said at last.</p>

<p>“Well?” he replied, looking up.</p>

<p>“Stuart, I do not often express my wishes, but to-day
I particularly desire you should go to Chesterham and
meet your aunt and cousin.”</p>

<p>Stuart removed his felt tennis-hat and bowed low.</p>

<p>“My lady-mother,” he said lightly, “your wishes shall
be obeyed.”</p>

<p>He put on his hat and strolled away, while a frown
settled on his mother’s face. She tapped her writing-table
with her pen, in evident vexation; but after a while
her brow cleared, as if some new thought had come into
her mind and by its bright magic dispelled the cloud.</p>

<p>Stuart Crosbie sauntered on over the lawn. A moment
before he had grumbled at a prospective walk in
the heat when the day would be declining, yet now he
made no haste to get out of the sun’s rays, although
trees whose spreading branches promised shade and
coolness studded his path. He had pushed his hat well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
over his eyes, and with his hands still in his pockets
dawdled on, as if with no settled purpose in his mind.</p>

<p>He had strolled in a circuitous route, for, after progressing
in this fashion for some time, he looked up and
found himself almost opposite to the window—though
at a distance—from which he had started. His mother’s
head was clearly discernible bent over her writing, and,
waking suddenly from his dreams, he left the lawn, betook
himself to a path, and made for a gate at the end.
The lodgekeeper’s wife was seated at her door, having
brought her work into the air for coolness. She rose
hurriedly as she perceived the young squire striding
down the path, and opened the gate.</p>

<p>“Why did you trouble, Mrs. Clark?” said Mr. Crosbie,
courteously. “I could have managed that myself.”</p>

<p>“Law sakes, Master Stuart, my good man would be
main angry if he thought I’d let you do such a thing!”</p>

<p>“Jim must be taught manners,” Stuart laughed lightly.
“How do you like this weather?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clark mopped her brow with her apron.</p>

<p>“It’s fair killing, sir,” she answered; “I never remind
me of such a summer. But folks is never content.
Mayhap what tries me is good for others—your young
lady cousin, for one, sir. Mrs. Martha tells me she is
very weakly like. She be coming to-day.”</p>

<p>“I have vivid recollections of Vane as a child,” Stuart
remarked, more to himself than to the woman; “and
certainly I can testify to her strength then, for she boxed
my ears soundly.”</p>

<p>“Laws, Master Stuart!” ejaculated Mrs. Clark. “What
a little vixen!”</p>

<p>“But these are tales out of school,” laughed the young
man; “and I fancy I tormented her pretty freely in those
days. Ta-ta, Mrs. Clark! Go back and have a nap—sleep
is the best way to pass these hot days.”</p>

<p>“Now, if he ain’t the best and kind-heartedest boy in
the whole world!” mused Mrs. Clark, watching him as he
strode along the lane. “Just like his father, poor gentleman!”</p>

<p>Mr. Crosbie went along the road at a fast pace, and
did not slacken his speed till he sighted a few cottages
that denoted a village. Then he moderated his pace, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
sauntered into the one street, hot and parched with
thirst.</p>

<p>“Phew!” he exclaimed to himself, taking off his hat
and waving it to and fro vigorously. “I must have something
to drink. I wonder if Judy keeps soda-water?”</p>

<p>“Judy” was the owner of a small shop, the one window
of which displayed a heterogeneous mass of articles—comestibles,
wearing apparel, tops, and scissors. It
did not look very inviting, but thirst must be quenched,
and better things might be in store behind the counter.
So Stuart raised the latch and entered the cottage.</p>

<p>“Soda-water, Master Stuart?” repeated Mrs. Judy, in
amazement. “I scarce count on what you mean. There’s
pump-water, if you like, or may be a glass of milk.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crosbie hesitated for a moment, then decided for
the latter.</p>

<p>“It is a long time since I drank so innocent a beverage,
Judy,” he observed, putting down the glass with a
slight shudder.</p>

<p>“Ay, there ain’t much ’arm in milk,” responded Judy.
“But, laws, Master Stuart, you do look warm! Will you
’ave a chair and set in the doorway to cool a bit?
There’s a little bit of wind springing up.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crosbie shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, thanks, Judy; I must get on. There”—throwing
a shilling upon the small counter—“take that for your
kindness.”</p>

<p>“Eh, but, Master Stuart, I’d like you for a customer
every day!” exclaimed the woman; and with a smile and
a nod Mr. Crosbie strode away.</p>

<p>He passed through the narrow street, deserted now—for
the sound of the children’s voices was wafted from
the village school—and turned into a wide country-lane
that led to the left of the cottages. After sauntering a
few yards, he came in sight of a wood inclosed by a high
wall, while through the branches of the trees glimpses of
a gray-stone house were visible. Mr. Crosbie’s steps
grew slower and slower as he approached this wall, and
he walked past it in a very desultory fashion. Presently
he reached a large iron gate through which a wide even
drive was seen. Evidently Mr. Crosbie had no acquaintance
with this drive, for he passed on, still down hill, till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
he came to a tiny spring trickling and babbling by the
side of the road; and here he paused. He was out of the
sun’s glare now, and felt almost cool; to his right hand
stretched the path he had just traversed, to his left lay
two lanes, one leading through the distant fields, the
other turning abruptly. He thought for an instant, then
turned in the direction of the latter, and just before him
stood three cottages at equal distances from each other.
He passed the first, and with a quick nervous hand unlatched
the gate of the second, and went up the sweet-smelling
garden.</p>

<p>The door was ajar, and as he knocked a faint, weak
voice answered:</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>Stuart Crosbie pushed open the door and entered the
cottage. A woman was lying on a sofa, propped up with
pillows, the whiteness of which rivaled her face in purity.
She had a woolen shawl round her shoulders, although
the heat was so oppressive, and looked very ill.</p>

<p>Stuart bent over her.</p>

<p>“How are you to-day, Mrs. Morris?” he asked, gently.</p>

<p>“Much about the same, thank you, Mr. Stuart. Were
you wanting Reuben, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I did rather want to see him,” replied the
young man a little hesitatingly. “I am anxious to hear
about that poaching affair the other night.”</p>

<p>“It weren’t nothing at all, sir,” Mrs. Morris said, in
her low, weak voice. “Reuben was out nigh most of the
night, but couldn’t see a soul.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad of it,” observed Mr. Crosbie warmly,
“for between ourselves, Mrs. Morris, I confess my sympathies
go entirely with the poachers.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“Ah, you ain’t Sir Hubert, sir! He don’t hold them
views. You would give the whole village welcome to
the birds; but he’s different.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are rather opposed in some ways,” remarked
the young squire, dryly. “Is it true, Mrs. Morris,
that Sir Hubert and Lady Coningham are coming
home?’</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; Mrs. Brown, the housekeeper, come to see
me yesterday, and she says her ladyship is expected next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
week. Ah, I am glad I shall see her again! I began to
fear I should die before she came back.”</p>

<p>“You must cheer up,” said Stuart, gently, “and not
talk about dying. Why are you here all alone? Where
is Margery?”</p>

<p>“She’s gone out, sir. She would go all the way to
Farmer Bright’s to fetch me some fresh eggs; our hens
are bad at laying just now. But she ought to be in directly,
sir. She started at dinner-time, and it’s now close
on three o’clock.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long walk to Bright’s farm,” observed Mr.
Crosbie, rising and strolling to the window, and stooping
apparently to sniff the bowl of flowers standing on
the ledge, but in reality to have a good look down the
hot, dusty lane.</p>

<p>“Ay, it is, sir; but Margery would go. She takes such
count on me, sir; and it’s her lesson day and all.”</p>

<p>“Is she still studying with the rector’s governess?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; her ladyship, when she wrote last, desired
her to continue the lessons, and Miss Lawson speaks
main well of Margery’s cleverness. I expect Lady Coningham
won’t know her when she sees her again.”</p>

<p>“Ten years would make a difference, Mrs. Morris,”
Stuart said, looking round with a smile; “and Margery
was only about seven when Lady Coningham went to
India. What a jolly little thing she was, too! We had
some fun in those days.”</p>

<p>“Margery is a bit of a tomboy now,” the sick woman
observed, with a loving light in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Is she? Well, I never see it; she always seems as
sedate as—well, as the rector’s governess herself. But
I must be off. Tell Reuben I looked in to hear about
the poachers, and that I don’t sympathize with him a
bit for spending the night in the wood.” He bent and
took one of the invalid’s thin white hands in his. “And
now don’t get low-spirited about yourself, Mrs. Morris;
you will feel better when this heat passes. I shall send
you some fruit down from the castle. I dare say you
can manage a few grapes.”</p>

<p>“Many, many thanks, Mr. Stuart, and Heaven bless
you, sir! You are very good to me.”</p>

<p>Tears rolled down Mrs. Morris’ pale face, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
young squire turned away with a sudden expression of
sorrow. At the door he hesitated for a minute, then said
hurriedly:</p>

<p>“I shall walk a little way along Linton’s Lane, Mrs.
Morris. I want to ask Margery about Bright’s crops.”</p>

<p>“Ay, do, sir,” replied the sick woman, warmly; “she
will be rare glad to see you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crosbie strode down the path, and let the gate
swing behind him. He turned to the right, and walked
quickly along in the glaring heat, with his eyes fixed in
an almost eager way on the long straight road before
him. Away in the distance appeared an object—a patch
of something pink moving very slowly toward him. His
pace increased, the distance lessened between this object
and himself, and gradually the pink patch melted into
the slender form of a girl, her bent head covered with a
flapping white sunbonnet, a small basket on her right
arm, and a book between her two little brown hands.
She came on very slowly; apparently the heat had no effect
on her, although the sun was beating on her with
scorching force. Mr. Crosbie slackened his pace as they
drew nearer, and at last came to a standstill. The girl
was so deeply absorbed in her book that she was unaware
of his presence till, looking up suddenly, she saw him
just in front of her. The book dropped, a flush of color
mantled her clear, transparent face, and a look of intense
pleasure shone in her great blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stuart! Oh, how you startled me!”</p>

<p>“Did I, Margery?” returned Stuart, removing his felt
hat and grasping her hand firmly. “What are you made
of? You must be a salamander to live in this heat; yet
here you are walking along as if it were in Iceland; and
you look as cool as”—hesitating for a smile—“as a
cucumber.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind a little sunshine!” said the girl, with
a slightly contemptuous curl of her short upper lip. “In
fact, I don’t feel it. But where are you going, Mr.
Stuart? Have you seen mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the young man, turning beside her and
taking the basket from her arm. “She told me you had
gone to Bright’s farm, and I am anxious to know how
his crops are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“He is grumbling, of course,” Margery answered; “but
I fancy he is, on the whole, well satisfied.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and they both burst into a merry fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>“You don’t care a bit about the crops—you know you
don’t!” remarked Margery, severely, as she tried to
banish the merriment from the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>“Well, strictly between ourselves, I don’t. It is a fearful
confession for a farm-owner to make, but it is the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I am glad you do tell the truth sometimes!” said
the girl, with a bright glance from her glorious eyes.</p>

<p>“You must be a witch or some sort of fairy,” Stuart
declared suddenly, “for prevarication, let alone untruths,
always fail when I meet you.”</p>

<p>He was watching her with intense earnestness, enjoying
the sweet witchery of her beauty. For she was beautiful;
her form was so slender and lithe; every limb, from
the tiny feet in the rough country shoes, which could not
hide their daintiness, to the small, delicately-shaped hands,
browned and tanned as they were, spoke of grace and
loveliness. Her head had a certain imperious carriage
that made the simple cotton gown appear a queenly robe,
and the face beneath the flapping sunbonnet was one
to inthrall a sterner man than Stuart Crosbie. The complexion
of pale cream white, which even the sun could
not kiss to a warmer shade, the sweet, rosy mouth, the
great wondrous eyes, fringed with long, dark lashes, and
the mass of ruddy golden curls that twined about the
brow and delicate throat were but a few of the attractions
that Margery possessed. One of her greatest charms was
the simplicity and unaffectedness of her manner; perhaps
it was that as yet none had whispered flattery in her shell-like
ear, none had tried to sweep away her girlish frankness
and youthfulness by adulation and undue admiration.
But Margery never seemed to think she possessed
beauty, nor even that that beauty was such as a queen
might sigh for. She found more pleasure in tossing the
hay, romping with the children, or, in quieter moods, diving
into her books, than in posing before her mirror; and
she was quite unconscious of the exact meaning of Stuart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Crosbie’s eyes, which filled with a fire of admiration and
ecstasy whenever they rested on her.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, lightly, turning her book round and
round in her hands after they had been conversing for
several minutes, “since I am a fairy, I shall get this question
answered. Why did Mr. Stuart take such a long
walk in the broiling sun which does affect him if he does
not care a scrap about Farmer Bright’s crops?”</p>

<p>“Why?” echoed the young man. “Why, to meet you,
Margery!”</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind of you!” she returned, quietly; then,
looking up with a smile, she added, “Come now—I shall
begin to doubt my power. What——”</p>

<p>“But that is the real downright, honest truth. I told
Mrs. Morris it was to ask about the crops, but I tell you
the truth.”</p>

<p>“And why could you not tell mother the truth,” she
asked, quickly—“why not say you wanted to see me?
She would have been honored at such a thought.”</p>

<p>Stuart Crosbie bit his lip. His brow clouded for a
second, then he answered quietly:</p>

<p>“Yes, you are quite right, Margery. I ought to have
said so. Well, never mind—I will next time. And now
tell me what you have been doing all this age. What is
that book?”</p>

<p>“‘The Mill on the Floss’”—holding it out.</p>

<p>“Hum! Looks dry—is it?”</p>

<p>“Dry!” exclaimed Margery. “Oh, it is so beautiful!
Have you never read it?”</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” confessed the young squire. “I
will look it out in the library when I get back, and dig
into it to-night, when I am smoking.”</p>

<p>“Miss Lawson doesn’t approve of story-books,” said
Margery; “but I am not so strict.”</p>

<p>“And how are you getting on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right! I am deep in German just now. I
speak French every day when I go to the rectory. I want
to be perfect by the time her ladyship comes back.
Mother has told me all about her kindness to me. I can
scarcely remember her when she went away, but she must
be nice.”</p>

<p>“Nice!” exclaimed Mr. Crosbie. “She is a brick—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
million times too good for that old curmudgeon, Sir
Hubert!”</p>

<p>“No one seems to like him,” Margery remarked,
thoughtfully—her face had grown almost sad; “but
mother is never tired of telling me all about Lady Coningham—how
she took me when I was a baby, and my poor,
dear real mother was killed, and put me with mother
Morris. I am not very old, Mr. Stuart, but I feel I can
never repay her ladyship all she has done for me. Sometimes
I seem to have a faint, misty recollection of the
days when I first came here, and I can see a face that
was—oh, so pretty and kind!”</p>

<p>“My mother always says Catherine Coningham was
very beautiful,” Stuart said, as the girl paused. “I remember
her as a faded, pale woman, very kind, as you
say.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing she did I can never, never forget,”
Margery went on—“that was her goodness in burying my
poor mother in such a pretty spot, and putting that cross
on her grave. It does me good to go there, Mr. Stuart.
I almost think my mother knows I go. She must have
been sweet, she was so beautiful! I always wear my
locket, you know”—she put up her hand and produced a
tiny heart of gold—“it is such a comfort. I wonder who
I really am!”</p>

<p>“I think you are a princess,” observed the young man,
gravely; “you look it.”</p>

<p>Margery shook her head.</p>

<p>“We shall never know, I suppose,” she said, sadly,
“and I shall always be the nursery rhyme girl ‘Margery
Daw,’ as Lady Coningham christened me.”</p>

<p>“It is the prettiest name in the whole world!” cried
Stuart, warmly. “And—and it suits you!”</p>

<p>“So you would say if you caught sight of me on the
village see-saw;” and Margery laughed heartily. Then
she added: “But we are home; and you have carried
my basket all the way. It must be nearly four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“No!” he exclaimed, incredulously. “By Jove, I shall
have to tear——” Then he stopped abruptly and asked:
“Margery, when are we going to have that picnic we
decided on a month ago?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, some day!” she answered, going into the garden
and closing the gate.</p>

<p>“But ‘some day’ is so vague. Shall we fix it for next
Wednesday? That is your half-holiday, I know.”</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed on her face with such earnestness
that for the first time she seemed to feel their power.
She colored faintly and held out her hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, Wednesday, if you like—if mother is well
enough to spare me. Good-by!”</p>

<p>“Good-by!” he answered.</p>

<p>He gave one last look and hurried up the hill. He
had a good hour’s walk before him, his toilet to make,
and the drive to Chesterham to accomplish as well. That
Lady Charteris and her daughter Vane would be received
at the station by the young squire of Crosbie Castle
seemed very improbable, indeed.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>


<p>The dressing-gong sounded sonorously through the
corridor of Crosbie Castle. In one of the many charming
rooms situated in the towering wing a young girl
was standing. The open windows overlooked a sweep
of verdant lawn, majestic groups of veteran trees, and to
the left a clump of smaller woodgrowth, touched with
every tint of green. From beneath, the scent of many a
flower was borne on the air and wafted to her, bringing
with its fragrance a sense of purity and delicacy that was
utterly wanting to the faint odors that hung round the
costly glass bottles her maid was placing on the toilet
table.</p>

<p>The mistress of the dainty apartment was leaning
against the open window deep in thought. She was tall
and slight, with a face of delicate loveliness and charm,
albeit spoiled a little by a slight expression of indifference
and discontent. She had hair of the warm brown
shade peculiar to Englishwomen; her eyes were large, of
a clear but rather cold blue; her mouth was small and
well shaped, disclosing white, even teeth when her lips
parted. There was an easy, graceful nonchalance about
her carriage; and, without being a strictly beautiful figure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Vane Charteris had an indescribable air of <i>hauteur</i>
in the slope of her shoulders and well-poised head that
put to shame many a rival better favored by nature. Her
eyes were fixed at this instant on the figure of a young
man walking quickly across the lawn to the house, followed
by half a dozen dogs. He was by no means unpleasant
to look upon; and so thought his cousin, for she
watched him with evident attention and interest.</p>

<p>“My squire of Crosbie pleases me,” she murmured,
moving languidly from the window; “for once mamma
has shown discrimination with worldly wisdom.”</p>

<p>She seated herself at the glass, and let her maid unpin
her luxuriant tresses till they fell upon the folds of her
pink silk wrapper in glorious profusion. Vane Charteris
had been out two years. Worshiped from her cradle
by her weak, widowed mother, she had entered society’s
world haughty, indifferent and selfish. The admiration
she received was but a continuation of the adulation that
had been lavished upon her all through her life; she had
no aims, no hopes, no ambitions, but was content with
her imperious beauty and the power that gift brought.
At first Vane was a great success—her proud coldness
was new, and therefore a delightful experience; but after
a while society grew weary of her autocratic ways. The
season just ended had been a lesson to her. She saw
herself deserted, and her power slip from her; and, as
this truth came home, she woke suddenly from her
dreams, and realized that something more was expected
of her if she would still reign as queen.</p>

<p>Lady Charteris little guessed the workings of her
daughter’s mind. She had grown to consider Vane as a
priceless jewel which must be carefully watched, carefully
tended and thought for. She judged the girl’s nature
to be one of the highest, combining true Charteris
pride with utter indolence. Possibly the mother had felt
a touch of vexation when she saw girls far below her
child in beauty wed nobly and well; but she loved Vane
as her life, and regret was banished in the pleasure of
her presence.</p>

<p>This was the first visit of the beautiful Miss Charteris
to Crosbie Castle. Hitherto she had contented herself
with meeting her uncle and aunt in London: but this year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the mood seized her to accept their oft-repeated invitation
and spend a few weeks in their country home. She
had heard much of her cousin Stuart, but had never seen
him since her childhood, as during the past two years he
had been traveling, and before that time she never left
the seclusion of her schoolroom.</p>

<p>Sore with the knowledge of her social failure, dissatisfied
with her mother, herself, and everybody, Vane had
sunk into a morbid, depressed state. She left town without
a sigh (though, when she contrasted this journey
with her migration of the former season, she might have
given vent to one, for instead of hearty farewells and
expressions of regret, she was neglected, save by her
maid and her mother), and actually felt a thrill of genuine
pleasure as she bowled through the country lanes and
drank in the sweetness of the air. She stole many hurried
glances at her cousin during the drive—Mr. Crosbie
had reached the station in the nick of time—and found
herself agreeing with the oft-repeated praises her mother
had sung concerning him. There was a manliness, a
frankness, an absence of self-consciousness and conceit
about Stuart Crosbie that pleased her jaded spirit; he
was as handsome as any of her former admirers, while
possessing many other advantages they did not. She
listened quite interestedly to his chatty accounts of his
travels, and was surprised at the pleasure she derived
from them.</p>

<p>“What will mademoiselle wear?” the maid asked, after
she had coiled and waved the luxuriant hair round the
graceful head.</p>

<p>Vane woke from her musings.</p>

<p>“Oh, anything, Marie; it does not matter! No; on
second thoughts, give me that plain white silk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>Marie went to the inner room, and returned with a
mass of soft, rich, clinging drapery on her arm, and assisted
her mistress to adjust the robe in silence. She
was wondering a little why mademoiselle should have
chosen so simple a gown—it was not her usual habit.
But, when the last touch was given, and Vane stood gazing
at her reflection in the mirror, the maid was fain to
confess the choice was good. The tall, supple form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
looked inexpressibly graceful in the long, soft folds, the
delicate masses of lace brought fichu-like across the bust
gave a touch of quaintness to the whole, and the purity
of the silk gave a softened, fresher look to the pretty
face, for once free from its discontent. Vane looked
long at herself, then turned to her maid:</p>

<p>“My gloves and fan, Marie. Thanks. Do not trouble
to wait for me to-night. Leave my wrapper here; I
will brush my hair myself. I dare say you are tired.”</p>

<p>“<i>Merci bien</i>, mademoiselle,” Marie murmured, marveling
still more. She was unaccustomed to any notice, to
say naught of kindly words, from her young mistress.</p>

<p>Vane drew on her long white gloves, then went slowly
through the corridor and down the stairs. The sun was
declining, the heat of the day dying, and a faint, delicious
breeze came in through the many open windows.
Miss Charteris passed through the great hall, the tap-tap
of her heels sounding distinctly on the tesselated
floor, and stood for one instant at a door that led first
under a colonnade and thence to the grounds which her
windows overlooked. While she was standing here her
cousin sauntered into view, and, moving forward with
languid grace, she went to meet him.</p>

<p>“<i>La dame blanche</i>,” he said, tossing away an unfinished
cigarette. “You startled me, Cousin Vane—you
crept out so quietly and look so like a spirit.”</p>

<p>“I am quite real, I assure you,” Vane answered. “But
why have you thrown away your cigarette?”</p>

<p>Stuart laughed as he answered:</p>

<p>“It is against my mother’s rules to smoke immediately
before dinner, but I love my weed, and am scarcely conscious
when I am smoking or not. Please forgive me.
I have been a savage for so long, I have forgotten my
good manners.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I want to hear all about your travels and adventures!”
said Miss Charteris. “Have we time to stroll up
and down for a while before dinner?”</p>

<p>“But you will be tired,” remonstrated Stuart, mindful
of his mother’s injunctions; “and”—glancing at the
small, dainty white feet—“I am afraid you will ruin your
pretty shoes!”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of either calamity,” Vane responded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
with a smile; “however, let us split the difference and go
to the conservatory.”</p>

<p>Stuart agreed willingly. He was most favorably impressed
by his new cousin. She was no hypochondriacal
creature, but a young, beautiful girl, and likely to prove
a most agreeable companion. He glanced at her dress as
they sauntered along the colonnade to the conservatory,
mentally declaring it to be most charming and simple,
deciding it to be most probably the work of her own
hands, and would have been thunderstruck had any one
informed him that the innocent-looking garment had cost
nearly fifty pounds.</p>

<p>Vane Charteris saw her cousin’s admiration, and her
heart thrilled. Once more she would taste the joy of
power, she would no longer be neglected. A vision of
future triumph filled her mind at that instant. She
would wake from her indifference. The world should
see her again as queen, reigning this time by charm and
fascination as well as by her beauty. The color mounted
to her cheeks, the light flashed in her eyes at the thought,
and she turned with animation and interest to converse
with the man beside her.</p>

<p>“You have a splendid home, Stuart,” she observed,
after they had walked through the heavily scented conservatory
to the drawing-room. “I am glad I have
come.”</p>

<p>“And I am heartily glad to welcome you. I have
heard so much of my Cousin Vane, such stories of triumphs
and wonders, that I began to despair of ever receiving
her here.”</p>

<p>“You forget,” said Vane, softly, waving her great
feather fan to and fro, “there is an attraction here now
that at other times was wanting.”</p>

<p>She spoke lightly, almost laughingly, but her words
pleased the man’s vanity.</p>

<p>“Can it be that I am that attraction?” he asked, quickly.
Then he added: “Cousin Vane, I am indeed honored.”</p>

<p>“You jump to hasty conclusions,” she retorted, “but I
will pardon your excessive vanity, if you will give me
a spray of stephanotis for my dress.”</p>

<p>“Is it your favorite flower?” he asked, leading the way
back to the conservatory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“I love all flowers,” Vane answered; “that is,” she
added, carelessly, “all hothouse flowers.”</p>

<p>“You shall be well supplied in future.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>She drew off her gloves and pinned the spray of wax-like
flowers amid her laces. Her hands were white and
delicate, yet Stuart’s mind unconsciously flew to two
little brown ones he had seen that afternoon grasping a
plainly bound book. There was even more beauty in
them than in his cousin’s, he thought.</p>

<p>“I shall look to you, Cousin Stuart,” Miss Charteris
observed, as she fastened her gloves again, “to initiate
me into the mysteries of country life. I intend to dabble
in farming, milk the cow, toss the hay, picnic in the
fields, and get quite burned and brown.”</p>

<p>Stuart laughed a little constrainedly. He was thinking
of his picnic for next Wednesday, and wondering
whether he could induce his cousin to be kind to Margery.
His mother, for some unaccountable reason, did
not appear to like Margery.</p>

<p>“We must get a native of Hurstley to act as cicerone,”
he responded, breaking off a leaf from sheer wantonness.
“I have been away so long, I have almost forgotten
my home.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, now you are back?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—that is, nothing definite. You see, my
father is very shaky, and I must relieve him of some of
his duties. My mother has a strong wish that I should
stand for Chesterham.”</p>

<p>“A parliamentary career?” questioned Vane. “How
would you like that?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Stuart answered, frankly. “Legislation
is not my <i>forte</i>. I am, if anything, a sportsman.”</p>

<p>“English to the backbone! Cousin Stuart, I am disposed
to like you.”</p>

<p>“Is that true?” Stuart asked, gravely.</p>

<p>Vane turned and met his gaze, then laughed softly.</p>

<p>“True? Of course it is; are we not cousins? The
liking, however, must not be altogether on my side.”</p>

<p>“Have no fear,” the young man began, but at that instant
the dinner-gong sounded, and his sentence remained
unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Vane was led in by her cousin, and they were even
yet more amicable during the meal, to Mrs. Crosbie’s
intense satisfaction. She made no effort to interrupt the
merry conversation of the young people, and contented
herself with now and then joining in the flow of reminiscences
in which her husband and Lady Charteris were
indulging.</p>

<p>Squire Crosbie was a tall, thin man with a worn, almost
haggard face. Its prevailing expression was kindly but
weak, and he turned instinctively to his wife for moral
support and assistance. Stuart dearly loved his father.
The gentle student disposition certainly was not in harmony
with his own nature; but he had never received
aught but tenderness and love from his father, and grew
to think of him as a feeble plant that required warmth
and affection to nourish it. His feeling for his mother
was entirely different. He inherited his strong spirit
from her, the blood of an old sporting family flowed in
her veins. She was a powerful, domineering woman, and
Stuart had been taught to give her obedience rather than
love. Had he been permitted to remain always with his
mother, his nature, although in the abstract as strong as
hers, might by force of habit have become weakened and
altered; but, as soon as he had attained his majority, he
had expressed a determination to travel, and in this was
seconded for once most doggedly by his father. Those
two years abroad did him an infinite amount of good;
but to Mrs. Crosbie they did not bring unalloyed delight.
Her son had gone from her a child obedient to
her will, he returned a man and submissive only to his
own.</p>

<p>Lady Charteris resembled her brother, the squire; but
the intellectual light that gleamed in his eyes was altogether
wanting in hers. Her mind was evidently fixed
on her child, for even in the thick of a conversation her
gaze would wander to Vane and rest on her. She was
heartily pleased now at her daughter’s brightness, and
whispered many hopes to Mrs. Crosbie that this visit
might benefit the delicate nerves and health.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie nodded absently to these remarks. She
was occupied with her own thoughts. Stuart must
marry; and whom could he find better, search where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
might, than Vane Charteris for his wife? Beautiful,
proud, a woman who had reigned as a social queen—in
every way she was fitted to become the mistress of Crosbie
Castle. She watched her son eagerly, she saw the
interest and admiration in his face, and her heart grew
glad. Of all things Mrs. Crosbie had dreaded during
those two years’ absence, the fear of an attraction or entanglement
had been most frequent, and not until she saw
him so wrapped up in his cousin Vane did she realize indeed
that her fears had been groundless.</p>

<p>“Get on your bonnet, child, and trot away! I shall be
content till you come back.”</p>

<p>“Mother, I don’t like to leave you to-day, you seem so
weak. Miss Lawson will not mind—let her stay with
you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris put out her weak hand and caressed the
soft silky hair.</p>

<p>“No, no, child,” she persisted, gently. “You must go
to yer lessons. Reuben will be ’ome directly; he’ll make
me a cup of tea; don’t you worrit yourself. It’s yer day
of German, too, and I want you to be well got on by the
time her ladyship comes home.”</p>

<p>Margery rose slowly from her knees.</p>

<p>“Well, I will go,” she said, regretfully; “but let me
make you comfortable. There is your book—why, you
are getting on quite fast, mother!—and here are the
grapes Mr. Stuart sent, close to your hand.”</p>

<p>“Heaven bless him for a kind, true-hearted gentleman!
Ah, there are few like him, Margery, my lass!”</p>

<p>“He is good, indeed,” replied the girl, a soft spot of
color appearing in her cheeks. “Now, I will go; but
first of all I will run into Mrs. Carter’s and ask her to
come and sit with you.”</p>

<p>She bent and kissed the transparent cheek, tied on her
sunbonnet, took up her books, and, with a parting smile,
went out of the doorway.</p>

<p>Her message delivered at Mrs. Carter’s cottage, Margery
went slowly up the hill, past the wall inclosing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
wood, on past the gate leading to the Weald, Sir Hubert
Coningham’s country-house, on and on, till she reached
the village. The rectory stood a little way beyond the
schoolhouse, close to the church, and, by the time she
reached the side gate, Margery had learned her lesson
by heart. The heat was quite as great as it was on the
afternoon she walked to Farmer Bright’s, now four days
ago; and she looked round anxiously at the sky, dreading
a cloud until Wednesday was gone and the picnic
with Mr. Stuart a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Somehow Margery found her lesson not so delightful
to-day; her attention would wander, and Miss Lawson
had to repeat a question three times in one of these moments
before she got a response. The governess put
down the girl’s absence of mind and general listless manner
to the heat, and very kindly brought the lesson early
to a close and dismissed her pupil.</p>

<p>Margery for the first time gave vent to a sigh of relief
when she received permission to go home, and she sauntered
through the village almost wearily. She was gazing
on the ground, ignorant of what was going on about
her, when the sound of ponies’ feet and the noise of
wheels behind her caused her to turn, and, looking up,
she saw Mrs. Crosbie, seated in her small carriage, close
at hand.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon, Margery,” Mrs. Crosbie said, in her
haughty, cold manner. “I am glad to have met you.
How is your mother?”</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon, madame,” replied the girl, calling
Mrs. Crosbie by the name the village always used, and
bending her head gracefully. “Thank you very much,
but I am afraid mother is very bad to-day; I did not
want to leave her, but she insisted. She grows very
weak.”</p>

<p>“Has Dr. Metcalf seen her to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame, but he said nothing to me—he looked
very grave.”</p>

<p>“I was going to send her down some beef tea and jelly,
but as I have met you it will save the servant a journey.
Get in beside Thomas; I will drive you to the castle, and
you can take the things to your mother.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie pointed to a seat beside the groom. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
was for some reason always annoyed when she came in
contact with this girl. In the first place, Margery spoke
and moved as her equal; she never dropped the customary
courtesy, nor appeared to grasp for an instant the
magnitude of the castle dignity. Mrs. Crosbie was wont
to declare that the girl was being ruined; that Catherine
Coningham had behaved like an idiot; that, because the
child had worn delicate clothes and the dead woman had
seemed in every way a lady, Margery should be brought
up and educated as such was preposterous. It was all
absurd, Mrs. Crosbie affirmed, a mere shadow of romance.
The letter in the mother’s pocket had plainly
stated her position—she was a maid, and nothing else, and
all speculation as to an honorable connection was ridiculous
and far-fetched. Mrs. Crosbie did not quarrel with
Lady Coningham for rescuing the baby from the workhouse—charity
she upheld in every way—but she maintained
that Margery should have been placed with Mrs.
Morris as her child, and that she should have learned her
A, B, C with the other village children in the village
school, and that the story of the railway accident and her
mother’s death should have been carefully withheld from
the child. Now the girl’s head was full of nothing but
herself. The mistress of Crosbie Castle opined that she
was fit for no situation, and consequently would come to
no good.</p>

<p>Margery was ignorant of all this; but she was never
entirely comfortable in Mrs. Crosbie’s presence. The
waif had within her the germ of pride every whit as
great and strong as that possessed by Stuart’s mother.
Hitherto she had had no reason to intrench herself in
this natural fortress, for all the village loved her; the
very fact that Lady Coningham had adopted and educated
her raised Margery in their eyes. So the girl had
received kindness, in many cases respect; and she was as
happy as the lark, save when a wave of mournful thought
brought back the memory of her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie wronged her. Margery had not a spice
of arrogance in her composition—she had only the innate
feeling that she was not of the village class, and, with
the true delicacy and instinct of a lady, forbore even to
express this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>There was plenty of room on the front seat, but Mrs.
Crosbie would not have dreamed of bidding the girl to
sit there—she relegated her to what she considered her
proper place, among the servants. Margery’s face
flushed a little.</p>

<p>“If you will allow me,” she said, with her natural
grace, “I will walk up to the castle, thank you very
much.”</p>

<p>“Do as I tell you,” commanded Mrs. Crosbie, quietly.
“Thomas, make room for Margery Daw.”</p>

<p>Margery bit her lip and hesitated for a moment, then
the memory of the poor sick woman at home came to
her. If she offended madame, mother would have no
more delicacies, so, without another word, she stepped in
and was driven briskly out of the village. She sat very
quiet beside the shy groom, and, opening her book, a collection
of short German stories, soon lost her vexation
in their delights.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie was unduly pleased with herself for
bringing this girl to her level, and she was determined to
lose no opportunity of continuing it in the future. As
they stopped at the lodge gates she turned to Margery:</p>

<p>“Get down and go along that path to the back part of
the house, and wait in the kitchen till I send for you.”</p>

<p>Margery obediently descended, and turned down the
sidepath as the ponies started off along the sweeping avenue
to the castle entrance. Why was madame so stern
and Mr. Stuart so kind? Margery pondered as she
walked on. Had she done anything wrong? Her mind
accused her of no fault; she could therefore arrive at no
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>The path she was following was one used by the gardeners,
and she soon arrived at a small gate, which, on
opening, led her to the paddock and kitchen gardens.
Margery toiled through the heat up to the courtyard, and,
after crossing this, entered a large door standing wide
open.</p>

<p>The cook and her handmaidens were indulging in
five-o’clock tea, and the mistress of the kitchen rose with
genial hospitality to press her visitor to partake of some,
too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“Now, do!” she urged, as Margery shook her head.
“You look fair fagged out.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mrs. Drew,” Margery said, simply;
unconsciously she recoiled from accepting anything that
came from Mrs. Crosbie. “I am not really tired.
Madame has driven me here from the village. I am to
take some things back to mother. If you don’t mind, I
will wait outside—it is rather hot in here.”</p>

<p>“Ay, do, child,” the cook answered; and she handed
out a large stool. “Put this just in the doorway, and
you’ll catch a little draught.”</p>

<p>With a smile Margery took the stool, and, placing it in
a shady corner, sat down and began to read. The courtyard
stretched along a quadrangle leading to the stables,
and, looking up now and then from her book, Margery
caught glimpses of the castle horses lazily switching their
tails in their comfortable boxes. The pony carriage was
driven in while she waited, and she watched with much
interest the small, sturdy ponies being unharnessed and
led away. It was a quaint, picturesque spot—the low-roofed
stables, the larger coach-house, a portion of the
gray-stone castle jutting out in the distance, with a background
of branches and faintly moving leaves. Margery
shut her book and let her eyes wander to the clear blue
sky seen in patches through the trees. She felt cool in
her little nook, and enjoyed the rest. The groom had discarded
his smart livery, and, in company with another
lad, was busily employed in cleaning the pony carriage,
the hissing sound with which he accompanied his movements
not sounding unmusical from a distance; and Margery
found herself smiling at his exertions and the confidence
that had succeeded his bashfulness. Suddenly,
while she was watching them, she saw the groom and his
companion draw themselves up and salute some one; and
then the next moment a figure came round the corner—a
figure in white tennis costume, with a white silk shirt
and large flapping hat. Margery felt her cheeks grow
warm, then they as quickly colored. Another figure stood
beside the tall one of the man, a dainty, delicate, lovely
form in a dress of ethereal blue, holding a large sun-shade
of the same color above her beautiful head.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Margery felt her heart sink. Never had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
she seen so fair a vision before; and the sight of those
two figures, so well matched and so close together,
brought a strange vague pain to her, the nature of which
she could not guess. She dropped her eyes to her book
again, and shrunk back into her corner, hoping to escape
notice. She was too far away to hear what was
said, and she began to breathe freely again after a few
minutes, when the faint sound of a musical voice was
borne on the air and the tones of a deep, clear voice she
knew well came nearer and nearer. She pulled her sunbonnet
well over her eyes and bent still lower over her
book as the voices drew closer.</p>

<p>“If you are ill after this, Cousin Vane,” she heard
Stuart say, “I shall never forgive myself. The heat is
terrific, you know. Are you quite sure you can manage
it?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” answered the woman’s voice. “I want to
see this poor doggie; besides, you tell me it is just as far
back again as round this way.”</p>

<p>“Just as far. Well, here we are! Poor Sir Charles, I
hope the old fellow is better.”</p>

<p>The two figures came into sight; they were about six
yards from Margery, and were walking slowly. She
could see the delicate blue drapery, the slender gauntleted
hand, though she did not raise her eyes; and she drew
back into her corner with a nervous dread such as she
had never felt hitherto.</p>

<p>Mr. Crosbie led his cousin to a small outhouse immediately
facing the kitchen door, and was about to open
the door, when, looking round, he saw Margery. His
face flushed for an instant; then, before his cousin could
perceive it, his embarrassment was gone.</p>

<p>“There, Vane,” he said, easily, opening the door and
pointing to a large collie lying on a heap of clean straw.
“Don’t be afraid; he won’t hurt you. Poor Sir Charles—poor
old fellow!” He stooped and took up a bandaged
paw. “I shall have you about in a day or two. He
wants some fresh water. Margery”—he left his cousin’s
side a little, and looked straight at the girl sitting up in
the corner—“Margery, will you kindly ask one of the
maids to bring me some water for Sir Charles?”</p>

<p>Margery put down her book without a word, went indoors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
brought a jug, then walked to the well a little to
the left, and, having filled the jug, approached him.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Why did you trouble, Margery?” said
Stuart, courteously. “How is your mother to-day?”</p>

<p>“She is no better, Mr. Stuart, thank you,” returned
Margery, in her clear, refined voice. “I am waiting for
some things madame is kindly going to send her.”</p>

<p>Vane Charteris had turned at the first sound of the
girl’s voice, and she was almost alarmed at the beauty of
the face before her. Beside the golden glory of that
hair, the depths of pathetic splendor in those eyes, the
pale transparency of that skin, her own prettiness simply
faded away. She noted the grace and ease with which
Margery moved, and immediately conceived a violent dislike
to this village girl.</p>

<p>“Vane, let me present to you one of my old playfellows—Margery
Daw. You were wanting some one to
point out all the beauties of Hurstley. I am sure no one
could do that half so well as Margery.”</p>

<p>Miss Charteris bent her head and smiled at her cousin.</p>

<p>“Many thanks, Stuart; but you forget we have planned
to discover the mysteries of the country together without
any assistance—a spice of adventure is always charming.”</p>

<p>Margery turned away, with a bow to Stuart—she did
not speak, or look at his companion—and she overheard
Miss Charteris say, with a scornful laugh, as she walked
back to her seat:</p>

<p>“Dear Cousin Stuart, you should be more merciful;
that girl’s hair is so painfully red, it makes me quite uncomfortable
in this heat.”</p>

<p>Margery did not hear the reply—her lips were quivering
and her hands trembling with mortification—and,
when she looked up again, the housekeeper was handing
her a basket, and the cousins were gone.</p>

<p>“Madame sends your mother some beef tea, a bottle
of brandy, and some fruit and jelly,” said the housekeeper,
closing the basket lid. “It is rather heavy; and
mind you, carry it carefully. Can you manage it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Margery, steadily. “Thank you; I am
much obliged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>She turned with her heavy load and walked across the
courtyard, her heart no lighter than her basket.</p>

<p>That lovely looking stranger had made fun of her—fun—and
to Mr. Stuart! Perhaps he had laughed, too.
The thought was too painful. And was she not a sight?
Look at her old pink gown, well washed and mended,
her clumsy boots, her sunburned hands. The memory of
that dainty figure looking like a fairy in her delicate garments
rose to her mind, and her head drooped. Yes, she
was a common village girl—madame treated her as such;
and now Mr. Stuart would turn, too. Oh, why could she
not tear aside the veil of mystery and know what she
really was? Could that face treasured in her locket be
only the face of a maid, or did her heart speak truly when
it called that mother madame’s equal?</p>

<p>Margery was pained and troubled as she took her way
along the paddock—pained not so much at the woman’s
words as at the thought that the man had re-echoed them
and deemed her stupid and plain. She had grown to look
on Stuart Crosbie as something bright and delightful in
her life. They had played together as children, and the
memory of that friendship was the strongest link in the
chain that held him as her hero. When he was away,
Stuart had written once or twice to Margery, sending her
views of the places he visited, and giving her long chatty
accounts of his travels. When he came home, they renewed
their intimacy; there was not a shadow of surprise
or fear in Margery’s mind when the young squire came
so frequently to see her.</p>

<p>She had no suspicion that this friendship would annoy
his mother or was in any way strange or uncommon.
She liked Stuart Crosbie; she could talk to him of her
studies, her pursuits—a sealed book in her home—and
gradually grew to welcome him as a companion with
whom she could converse easily and naturally, and as a
friend who would never fail her. Mrs. Morris was too
great an invalid to devote much thought to the girl’s
amusements, nor would she have been greatly troubled
had she known how intimate the young squire and Margery
had become; so the girl had had no constraint put
upon her; she met, walked, and chatted with Stuart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Crosbie as freely as she liked, and no cloud had dawned
on her happy life till to-day.</p>

<p>The sight of that other girl, so different from herself,
had brought a strange, sharp pang, but that was lost in
the pain she endured when she thought that Stuart had
agreed with the cruel remark, and that his friendship
was gone forever. She wended her way along the paddock,
and was turning through the gate to enter the gardeners’
path again, when a hand was stretched out from
beside her, took the basket from her, and, putting a
finger under her chin, raised her head from its drooping
position.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Stuart, quietly.</p>

<p>“Give me my basket, please, Mr. Stuart,” Margery
murmured, hurriedly, a crimson wave of color dyeing her
cheeks.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the young man, calmly.</p>

<p>“I must get home. I am very late as it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you go?” Stuart inquired, watching
the color fade from her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I cannot go without my basket,” Margery answered,
trying to be at her ease. “Please give it to me, Mr.
Stuart.”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, briefly.</p>

<p>“Then I must go without it!” she exclaimed; and, suiting
the action to the word, she began to move down the
path.</p>

<p>Stuart followed at once, and put a detaining hand on
her arm.</p>

<p>“Here is your basket, Margery. I was only teasing
you. What a time you have been! I have been waiting
here for you for the last five minutes.”</p>

<p>Margery’s heart grew lighter again.</p>

<p>“You might have been better employed,” she returned,
with the quaint sharpness Stuart always admired. “But,
if you have time to waste, I have not. Listen! There—it
is striking six, and mother will wonder what has become
of me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is six,” observed Mr. Crosbie, listening to
the clock chiming from the castle. “You will get home
by seven, Margery, if you start at once. Not that way!”—as
she turned again down the path. “This is nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
half a mile nearer.” He pushed open the gate and motioned
her into the paddock again. “Now,” he continued,
slinging the basket on his arm and turning beside her
across the field, “why are you cross with me, Miss Margery?”</p>

<p>“I am not cross with you,” Margery answered, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Not now, perhaps; but you were.”</p>

<p>Margery was silent.</p>

<p>“What was it, Margery?” he asked, gently.</p>

<p>“I heard what that lady said about me just now,” she
replied, after a pause; “and—and——”</p>

<p>“You are angry with me. That is hardly fair—rough
on an old friend, you know.”</p>

<p>“I thought you might have——” She stopped.</p>

<p>“Agreed with her. You ought to know me better than
that, Margery.”</p>

<p>The grave tones went to her heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, forgive me!” she cried. “It was wrong; but—she
is so beautiful, and I——”</p>

<p>“You are——”</p>

<p>“Only a village girl beside her.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if you know how different you are from
her?” Stuart said, quietly.</p>

<p>Margery’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“I never felt I was—common till to-day,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Margery!”</p>

<p>She looked up quickly. Mr. Crosbie checked his words
and laughed a little constrainedly.</p>

<p>“You must not grow vain,” he said.</p>

<p>“Am I vain? I will remember another time,” she responded,
gravely.</p>

<p>“And remember this, too,” Stuart added—“that, whatever
any one may say, my opinion of you does not change—never
will.”</p>

<p>She smiled with delight.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Stuart,” she said, simply. “And
now please give me my basket; you must not come any
further.”</p>

<p>“I shall carry it home for you,” he answered. “We
shall not be long, and this is tons too heavy for your little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
hands. Tell me of your lesson. What have you done to-day,
and what is that book?”</p>

<p>Margery immediately broke into a long account of her
studies, and, with her happy serenity restored, she walked
on beside him, heedless of the dust or the sun—content
that their friendship was unaffected.</p>

<p>Stuart Crosbie listened with pleasure to the ripple of
her voice, his eyes never tired of wandering to her sweet
face, lovely in its innocence; but, when he had parted
from her and strode home along the lanes, his brow was
clouded and a puzzled expression rested upon his face.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>


<p>Wednesday morning broke clear and cloudless. Margery
rose at an early hour, and sat looking out of her little
window at the sun gilding the fields and trees with its
glory. Stuart Crosbie, too, rose earlier than was his
wont; and he occupied the time till the breakfast-gong
sounded in walking up and down his room, apparently in
deep thought. As the muffled summons reached his ear,
he uttered an impatient “Pshaw!” and made his way
slowly down the stairs. His mother was seated at the
table when he entered the room; and he had scarcely exchanged
greetings with her when Vane Charteris made
her appearance. It was not Miss Charteris’ usual custom
to honor the breakfast table with her presence; but
since her stay at Crosbie the mood had seized her, and
she descended regularly to the early meal.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my dear,” said Mrs. Crosbie, smiling
her sweetest. “You look as fresh as a rose; doesn’t she,
Stuart?”</p>

<p>“Words always fail me to describe Cousin Vane’s
beauty,” was his gallant reply.</p>

<p>Vane smiled languidly; but she was not quite happy.
There was something strange about this cousin of hers;
he was attentive, but his attentions seemed to be the outcome
of habit rather than inclination. Was her power to
fail her here, too?</p>

<p>“What is the programme for to-day?” she asked, as she
drew her chair to the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“We must devise something,” observed Mrs. Crosbie.
“Ah, Vane, my dear, I fear you find this place very dull!”</p>

<p>“Dull!” repeated Miss Charteris. “I cannot tell you,
my dear aunt, how happy I am in your lovely home.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie felt her heart swell; more and more she
saw the advisability of a marriage between Stuart and
his cousin, more and more she determined it should take
place.</p>

<p>“Well, Stuart, what are we to do to amuse Vane?” she
inquired, turning to her son, with the pleasure called up
by her niece’s speech still lingering on her face.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, mother, I shall not be able to offer my
services to-day. I am bound for Chesterham this morning,”
Stuart answered, vigorously attacking a pie on a
side table.</p>

<p>“Chesterham!” ejaculated his mother. “Why, what
takes you there, Stuart?”</p>

<p>“An appointment with Derwent. He has written and
asked me to meet him at the junction on his way to town;
he wants to see me.”</p>

<p>“Why could not Captain Derwent come here for a few
days?” inquired Mrs. Crosbie, coldly. She was annoyed
that anything should interrupt the acquaintance that was
progressing so satisfactorily.</p>

<p>“He can’t; he is due in London.”</p>

<p>“But must you go?” began his mother, when Vane interrupted
with:</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t stop him, auntie, dear, or he will vote
me such a nuisance! Indeed; we can spare Stuart for
one day, and I will enjoy myself with you if you will let
me. We have not driven to any places yet; shall we not
go somewhere to-day?”</p>

<p>“I shall be pleased,” Mrs. Crosbie replied, though she
looked vexed; and all other remarks on the subject were
stopped, to Stuart’s great relief, by his father’s appearance—Lady
Charteris never left her room till noon.</p>

<p>The squire came in with his curious halting gait; he
carried a bundle of letters and papers in his hand, and
his haggard features wore a look of surprise.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my dear,” he said to Vane. “Constance”—to
his wife—“I have received a most extraordinary
surprise. Read that”—holding out a letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>With ill-concealed impatience Mrs. Crosbie took the
letter he held toward her.</p>

<p>“What sort of a surprise, dad?” asked Stuart, putting
his hand for an instant into his father’s.</p>

<p>“Your mother will tell you,” answered the squire.</p>

<p>“From Douglas Gerant!” exclaimed Mrs. Crosbie, gazing
at the end of the letter. “This is a surprise indeed!
Why, Sholto, he is in England—has been for the last
month—and wants to come to us for a visit!”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” was Stuart’s only utterance.</p>

<p>“It seemed like a letter from the dead,” said the squire,
dreamily. “What years since one has heard or seen anything
of Douglas Gerant! It must be fifteen, at least,
since he left England.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie folded up the letter.</p>

<p>“He is not changed,” she observed—“at least, his letter
is as strange and erratic as of old. Vane, you have heard
your mother speak of Douglas Gerant, have you not?”</p>

<p>Miss Charteris puckered her brow.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember his name,” she replied. “Who is
he?”</p>

<p>“Your mother’s cousin—surely she must have spoken
of him!”</p>

<p>“I have heard of Eustace Gerant,” Miss Charteris answered,
“but he is dead.”</p>

<p>“This is his brother. He, too, might have been dead
for all that we have seen or heard of him. He was a
ne’er-do-wee’l, an utter scamp.”</p>

<p>“But with great good in him,” added the squire,
warmly. “I know you did not think so, Constance, but
Douglas always had a fine, generous nature.”</p>

<p>“It was well hidden, then,” his wife retorted, coldly.
“I never had much sympathy with him, and I have less
now. A man has no right to be lost to the world, as he
has been, and leave a magnificent inheritance wasting and
neglected when there are others who would prize it.”</p>

<p>“Is this the long-lost cousin who owns Beecham Park?”
asked Vane, with sudden interest. “Oh, then I have
heard of him, of course!”</p>

<p>“He came into the property ten years ago,” Stuart explained,
“and he has not come home till now. I must
confess I always had a strong sympathy for this unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
cousin. What a strange life his has been! I am tempted
to envy him the wonders he must have seen.”</p>

<p>“I am surprised you should speak like that, Stuart,”
said his mother, coldly. “I cannot understand any man
of principle putting aside his duties for his inclinations.”</p>

<p>Miss Charteris looked bored.</p>

<p>“Is he married?” she asked, languidly.</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear,” answered Mrs. Crosbie, quickly;
“by some marvelous chance he has escaped matrimony. I
always expected to hear of a low-born wife; but he appears
to have a little of the Gerant pride within him, and
has spared us that humiliation.”</p>

<p>“Then he has no heir?” Vane observed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie did not reply immediately, but Miss Charteris
saw her handsome eyes wander to Stuart’s face and
rest there.</p>

<p>“He has the power of willing Beecham Park,” Mrs.
Crosbie remarked; and the squire broke in with his quiet,
monotonous voice:</p>

<p>“I have often wished Douglas had married; he was just
the man to be led to good things by a good woman.”</p>

<p>“You always were absurd on this subject, Sholto,” his
wife remarked, quietly; and the squire discreetly said no
more.</p>

<p>Stuart moved from the table as the meal ended, and,
engrossed with the newspaper, was lost to all that was
passing around.</p>

<p>“I will write this morning and bid Douglas welcome,”
Mrs. Crosbie said after a while. As she rose, she turned
to the butler—“Fox, tell Mrs. Marxham to prepare some
rooms for Sir Douglas Gerant; I expect he will arrive to-morrow.
Now, Vane, I will leave you for half an hour;
then, if you will equip yourself, we will drive this morning.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, auntie,” and Miss Charteris walked slowly
across the room to one of the long French windows, looking
thoughtful and not altogether displeased.</p>

<p>“The power to will Beecham Park,” she mused; “and
the heir must be Stuart Crosbie. His mother’s eyes spoke
that plainly.”</p>

<p>Miss Charteris glanced at the tall, well-built form of
Stuart, who was still intent on the newspaper, and for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
first time the thought of a warmer feeling dawned in her
heart. She found this cousin a more agreeable companion
than she had imagined; she was irresistibly attracted by
his manliness and charm of manner. Might she not
gratify her ambition, as well as her fancy, if she chose
this young man for her husband? As mistress of Crosbie
Castle she would once again reign in her world, but as
mistress of Crosbie Castle and Beecham Park her sovereignty
would be greater than she had even dreamed of.
Vane felt her heart swell within her at the glorious prospect
her imagination conjured up; and, standing in the
soft morning sunlight, she vowed to link her lot with
Stuart Crosbie and be his wife.</p>

<p>She left the window and walked toward him.</p>

<p>“You are most unkind, Mr. Crosbie,” she said, looking
sweetly plaintive. “You are going to leave me all day,
and you bury yourself now in those dry papers.”</p>

<p>Stuart put down the newspaper quickly; he had been
utterly unconscious of her presence.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Vane,” he said, smiling; “indeed
it was very rude of me.”</p>

<p>“I forgive you this time,” she returned, extending her
white hand, “on condition that you promise to come home
early from your meeting with this tiresome man.”</p>

<p>Stuart colored faintly. It was true that he had received
a letter from his friend, Captain Derwent; also
true that that friend would pass through Chesterham at
some time during the day; but Stuart’s appointment was
not with Captain Derwent. In an hour’s time he was to
meet Margery, and start for their picnic in the woods.</p>

<p>“I shall get back as soon as I can,” he said, hurriedly.
“In truth, Vane, I am afraid that you find Crosbie horribly
dull; there is nothing or no one to amuse you. It
will be better in a day or two, for I intend to invite one or
two people for the twelfth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want them,” Miss Charteris observed, raising
her large blue eyes to his; “and do you know, Cousin
Stuart, strange though it may seem, I am not at all dull
in your society.”</p>

<p>Stuart bowed low at her words.</p>

<p>“You are easily satisfied,” he replied; and at that moment
his mother reappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“Now, Vane, I am at your service. By the by, Stuart,
shall we not drive you to Chesterham? I can easily drive
the barouche instead of the pony carriage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thanks!” he answered, hurriedly. “I prefer
to walk.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie elevated her eyebrows, but made no remark;
and Vane followed her aunt from the room. On
reaching the door, she looked back and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>“<i>Au revoir</i>, Cousin Stuart!” she said, lightly. “Don’t
stay away too long.”</p>

<p>Stuart waited only till the ladies had well disappeared,
then he walked across the hall, caught up his tennis hat,
and made his way along the colonnade to the grounds.
He stopped at the entrance to the courtyard and whistled
for his dogs, then, without another look round, started
across the paddock to the village.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Margery was dressed early, and had packed a small
basket with some home-made cakes and some apples as
provender for the picnic. She had told Mrs. Morris of
her holiday and Mr. Stuart’s kindness, and occupied herself
with many little duties of love for the sick woman
before she left her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris watched with tender eyes the slender form
flitting about the room in its plain white cotton gown.
All the wealth of her childless heart was bestowed on
this girl, and in return she received pure and deep affection.</p>

<p>“Now, are you quite sure, mother, you will not miss
me?” asked Margery, kneeling by the couch when all her
duties were done.</p>

<p>“Nay, that I cannot say,” Mrs. Morris returned, with a
faint smile. “I always miss you, child; but I shall not
want you. Mrs. Carter is coming in to see me, and
Reuben has promised to come home for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Reuben will keep his word, then,” declared the girl;
“but I shall not be away long.”</p>

<p>“Stay and amuse yourself, Margery—you are young,
and should have pleasure. Now, get on your bonnet
and start, or you will keep the young squire waiting.”</p>

<p>Margery tied on her sunbonnet. At first she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
been tempted to don her Sunday hat, a plain, wide-brimmed
straw with a white ribbon, but she checked herself
and put it away, with a blush at her vanity. She
took her little basket, and, walking slowly toward the
spring, sat down by its musical trickling to wait. She
felt more than ordinarily happy; the memory of Stuart’s
kind words had driven away the sting of his cousin’s
remark; there was not a cloud on the horizon of her
young life. She wanted for nothing to complete her
happiness, and reveled in the sunshine and the golden
glory of summer as only a heart can that has tasted no
sorrow, seen not the darkness or gloom of pain.</p>

<p>She had not waited long before the sound of hastening
footsteps told her that Stuart was at hand; and she
bent to caress the dogs as he approached, thus hiding the
pleasure that dawned on her face.</p>

<p>“I am fearfully late, Margery,” Stuart said, apologetically,
as he flung himself down on the cool, mossy
bank. “By Jove! though, I had no idea I could walk
so fast. I have come here in no time.”</p>

<p>“You do look tired,” she said, quickly; “let us rest a
while. Shall I get you some milk?”</p>

<p>Stuart shuddered. The thought recalled all the horrors
of Judy’s draught that summer morning.</p>

<p>“No, thanks; I will have some water. Do you know,
Margery, I don’t believe I can go very much further.
What do you say to a picnic in the Weald wood?”</p>

<p>“I think it will be very nice. But, Mr. Stuart, where
is your basket?”</p>

<p>“My basket?” he echoed.</p>

<p>“Yes—your lunch,” said Margery, holding out her
tiny hamper. “You have forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have. Will it matter?” asked Stuart, gravely,
thinking he had never seen so sweet a picture as the
girl before him.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, to picnic it is necessary to have some
food; but perhaps I have enough for both.”</p>

<p>“I devoutly hope so!” exclaimed Mr. Crosbie. “May
I ask, Margery, what your basket contains?”</p>

<p>“Cakes and apples,” she answered, promptly.</p>

<p>“Hum!” observed Stuart, meditatively. “That sounds
solid, Margery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you like cakes and apples?”</p>

<p>“Do you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Very much.”</p>

<p>“Then I do, too. Now let us get into the woods. By
the by, is Reuben about?”</p>

<p>“No; I believe he has gone to some of Sir Hubert’s
farms. He started very early this morning, but he will
be home to dinner. Did you want him, Mr. Stuart?”</p>

<p>“No, not particularly. But what a lark if they take
us up for trespassing—eh, Margery!”</p>

<p>Margery laughed heartily at the idea.</p>

<p>“What would they do to us?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Transport us for life, perhaps,” Stuart replied, with
a laugh, as he mounted the narrow wall. “How would
you like that, Margery?” he added.</p>

<p>“Would that mean going away from here?”</p>

<p>Stuart nodded.</p>

<p>“I should not like it at all, then,” she declared.</p>

<p>“Then you intend to live in Hurstley all your life?
Give me your hand; there—that is right. The dogs will
clear it.”</p>

<p>Margery jumped lightly from the wall to the soft turf,
and then watched the easy way in which the collie and
retriever scaled the wall.</p>

<p>“How clever they are!” she cried, stooping to pat them.</p>

<p>“But you have not answered me. Do you intend to
live here all your life?” said Stuart, as they strolled in
the cool shade of the trees.</p>

<p>Margery looked at him quickly.</p>

<p>“I have never thought about it, Mr. Stuart,” she replied.
“Would it be wrong to wish it?”</p>

<p>“Wrong?” he repeated. “No, Margery, of course
not.”</p>

<p>“I love Hurstley,” the girl went on, thoughtfully.
“Mother lives here, and Reuben, and Lady Coningham,
though I cannot remember her well—still I love her;
then there are Miss Lawson and all the village.”</p>

<p>“No one else?” queried Mr. Crosbie, fixing his eyes on
her face.</p>

<p>“Yes—you, Mr. Stuart,” Margery answered, softly.
“You are here, too.”</p>

<p>“But suppose that all these friends were to go away—suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
you were left alone—would you care for Hurstley
then?”</p>

<p>Margery’s face paled.</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” she murmured. “Oh, I
could not stay then; it would be terrible!”</p>

<p>Stuart opened his lips as if to speak, then closed them
firmly again, and for a while there was silence between
them as they walked. At last the young squire spoke.
They had reached a clump of trees, a cooler, shadier spot,
and here he stopped.</p>

<p>“Let us unpack that gigantic basket here, Margery,”
he said, lightly. “This is the very nook for a picnic.”</p>

<p>Margery tossed off her bonnet, and the young man,
stretched at full length on the soft grass, feasted his
eyes on her radiant beauty, feeling that with every look
his determination to see less of this girl was slipping
from him, and that for him happiness was found only
when in her presence.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Vane Charteris found the day pass very slowly, with
no one but her aunt to amuse her. She sat listlessly beside
Mrs. Crosbie during the long drive, feeling bored
and wearied, and yawned through the afternoon in her
room, finding no pleasure in her mother’s society and
less in her own. The thought that had come to her
suddenly in the morning grew stronger as the hours
passed. As Stuart Crosbie’s wife, she would taste once
more the sweetness of her lost power.</p>

<p>She was leaning by her open window, thinking this,
heedless of the beauty of the picture that stretched before
her, when her eyes fell on a man’s figure strolling
leisurely on the lawn—a strange, odd-looking man, who
seemed not quite at home in his surroundings. Miss
Charteris, roused from her languor, watched him intently,
and at once determined that the intruder was a
tramp—perhaps one of a gang of thieves. She rose
quickly, and made her way from her room, picking up
her sun-shade as she went. Her aunt was out at a garden
party, which she had vainly tried to induce Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Charteris to attend, her mother was enjoying a <i>siesta</i>, and
her uncle was absorbed in his books. There was no one
about, and the castle seemed quite deserted as Vane
walked across the hall to the back grounds. The man
was standing as she had seen him last, his hands in his
pockets, his hat pulled low over his brows. She went
toward him at once.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” she asked. “Do you
know you are trespassing?”</p>

<p>The man turned at her first word; he looked at her
keenly from a pair of earnest gray eyes, then slowly, and
with unmistakable courtesy, removed his slouched felt
hat.</p>

<p>“Trespassing?” he repeated, in a cool tone. “Do they
prosecute at Crosbie Castle if a man is found gazing
only?”</p>

<p>“You are insolent,” Miss Charteris responded, frigidly;
“and, if you do not leave at once I shall send some of
the servants to you.”</p>

<p>The man replaced his hat, with a curious expression
on his face.</p>

<p>“Pray save yourself that trouble,” he said, dryly. “I
am going; but may I ask if I have the honor of speaking
to Mrs. Crosbie?”</p>

<p>Vane’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, coldly.</p>

<p>“Ah! Miss Crosbie, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“No,” she repeated again.</p>

<p>“Indeed! Then, madame, by what right do you eject
me?”</p>

<p>“I am Mrs. Crosbie’s niece, and, in her absence, do
what I know she would desire.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Crosbie’s niece!” repeated the man. “So Mrs.
Crosbie rules this castle! Where is the squire?”</p>

<p>Miss Charteris moved away a little.</p>

<p>“I shall answer no more questions,” she said, quietly.
“I must request you to go away at once.”</p>

<p>“There spoke George Charteris!” muttered the stranger,
as if to himself.</p>

<p>Vane started; she could hardly believe her ears. This
shabby man to mention her father’s name! It was extraordinary,
and not pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“I do not know who you are,” she said, with marked
irritation; “but you have heard what I said, and you take
no notice of my words. It now remains for the servants
to see if they will be more successful.”</p>

<p>“Softly, softly, my young lady!” said the man, putting
his hand on her arm. “You are much too hasty, and,
like all intemperate spirits, judge by appearances only.
How do you know whether I have business here or not—whether
my visit may not be that of a friend?”</p>

<p>“Friend?” echoed Miss Charteris, sarcastically, at the
same time hurriedly drawing her arm from his touch.</p>

<p>“I see,” continued the stranger, half closing his eyes,
and fixing her with a look which annoyed and fidgeted
her. “I see you count Squire Crosbie’s friends by the
cut of their coats. Stay; let me convince you that people
are not always what they seem.”</p>

<p>At that moment a footman was passing along the
colonnade; and, calling in a loud voice, the stranger attracted
his attention.</p>

<p>“Is your master in?” was the question, put easily and
naturally.</p>

<p>The footman hesitated for an instant; but the presence
of Miss Charteris reassured him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Kindly inform him that I am here.”</p>

<p>“What name, sir?” the man asked.</p>

<p>“Sir Douglas Gerant.”</p>

<p>The footman bowed and turned away, while Vane felt
that she wished the ground would open and swallow up
this queer, dried, cynical cousin or herself—it mattered
not which. Never had she been in so disagreeable a
position. Sir Douglas came to her rescue.</p>

<p>“Will you forgive me?” he said, quietly extending his
hand, a long, thin white hand, which seemed strangely at
variance with his rough, ill-cut clothes.</p>

<p>“It is I who must ask that,” she replied. “Of course,
had I known——”</p>

<p>“Naturally, naturally,” interrupted Sir Douglas. “Let
us say no more about it. So my cousin Constance is
out? Well, I hope she will forgive me for taking her
by storm in this way. And where is her boy?”</p>

<p>“Stuart has gone to Chesterham.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Hum! And is he a nice fellow? Do you like him?”</p>

<p>Miss Charteris hesitated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, slowly, “I like Stuart very much.
You will see him this evening.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” observed Sir Douglas again; and at that instant
the squire’s tall, thin figure appeared, a look of undisguised
pleasure on his face.</p>

<p>“My dear Douglas!”</p>

<p>“Sholto, old fellow!”</p>

<p>The two men clasped hands; no words of stronger
welcome were spoken, but their eyes looked all they
would say; the handgrip testified more plainly than
words. What memories filled the mind of each as they
stood thus face to face—the traces of the world’s buffets
in their worn lineaments—memories of two young forms
with hope and vigor shining in their glowing eyes, determination
and ambition strong in their hearts.</p>

<p>“Welcome—a thousand times welcome!” said the
squire, after a moment’s silence. “I received your letter
this morning. We expected you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought so; but I am not an orthodox person
at all. I break through all rules and regulations. I
look like a tramp. Ask this young lady if she does not
think so,” he added, abruptly.</p>

<p>Vane’s face flushed—she was inwardly much annoyed;
but Sir Douglas continued, speaking easily, and her confusion
was unnoticed.</p>

<p>“I was eager to see you, Sholto, and I started off
almost as soon as I dispatched my letter. I have had a
great wish to see you for the last month.”</p>

<p>“I am heartily glad to meet you once more,” the
squire responded; and his face looked brighter than
usual. “But how have you come, Douglas?”</p>

<p>“On foot,” returned Sir Douglas, calmly. “My man
will arrive with my traps in about an hour’s time.”</p>

<p>“On foot from Chesterham! You must be tired out.
Come to my study. What volumes of anecdotes we
could write, Douglas, of our respective lives! Vane, my
dear, will you come with us?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Miss Charteris, with a forced smile. “I
will go and tell mamma that Sir Douglas has arrived.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>She moved away gracefully as she spoke; Sir Douglas
looked after her.</p>

<p>“That is George Charteris’ girl?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. She is very beautiful, is she not?” returned the
squire, dreamily.</p>

<p>“Hum!” observed Sir Douglas to himself. “She may
be; but——”</p>

<p>The sentence was left unfinished, and the strange guest
followed the squire into the house.</p>

<p>“How unchanged it all is!” he remarked, as he entered
the great hall. “I seem to have stepped back into
my boyhood again, Sholto. Ah, we don’t wear as well
as bricks and mortar, old fellow! Only a few short
years, and we are both wrecks of what we were!”</p>

<p>They had entered a smaller apartment at the back of
the building, one used by the squire as his study and own
special sanctum. Books and pamphlets were carelessly
strewn about; and the room, in its plain appointments,
told clearly and distinctly the character of its owner.</p>

<p>The squire pushed forward a large chair to the window,
and Sir Douglas, throwing off his hat, seated himself
in it, whilst the squire settled himself at the table.</p>

<p>“Did my letter startle you?” asked Sir Douglas suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it did,” was the candid answer. “I had begun
to think you would never return to England, that you
would die as you have lived, a wanderer from your
home.”</p>

<p>“A weary, restless wanderer—a man, Sholto, with but
one thought in his mind, one desire in his wanderings,
one wish that has never been fulfilled. Ah, you have
judged me as the world has judged me, an ill-conditioned
fellow who loved all nations and people above his own!
But you have wronged me—the world has wronged me.
I am as capable of strong domestic feeling as any man
living. I am what I am through trickery and deceit.”</p>

<p>The squire gazed earnestly at his cousin’s face, the
thin features illumined by a sudden rush of color. Sir
Douglas turned, and, as his eyes met that earnest gaze,
he sunk back slowly in his chair, and the old cynical look
came back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“I must not bore you with my hidden griefs, Sholto,”
he said, dryly; “they are musty and gray now with age.”</p>

<p>“You mistake if you think they bore me. I have never
judged you hardly, Douglas. Your nature was not a
common one. To me your life has fitted your nature.”</p>

<p>“My life,” echoed the guest a little sadly. “What a
weary turmoil it seems looking back at it now, what
ceaseless restlessness! Ah, cousin, you have had the best
of it, after all!”</p>

<p>The squire made no reply.</p>

<p>“Let us bury by-gones—they leave a bitter taste behind.
I will come to the present, Sholto. I wrote to you
with one idea and thought prominent in my mind. In
another month or so I shall leave England again, perhaps
this time never to return; but, before I go, I want to
leave my old inheritance an heir, and I must find him
here.”</p>

<p>“Here!” repeated the squire. “You forget, Douglas,
I am seven years your senior, and in all probability——”</p>

<p>“I do not mean you. You have a son.”</p>

<p>“Stuart?” exclaimed the squire. “Yes. You have
never seen him, Douglas. He is the best in the world.”</p>

<p>“I do not need your word to tell me that. I have
heard of this son. The world is very small, and my ears
are always sharp. He was in Calcutta last year. Yes,
and I was there, too.”</p>

<p>“Then you know him?”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas shook his head.</p>

<p>“I never saw; but I heard of his good, warm, generous
nature, and, judging him as your son, my heart
went out to him.”</p>

<p>“It is a noble offer,” the squire said, in his quiet, simple
way. “But is there no one whom you would care to
select outside the family? Stuart will inherit the castle,
remember.”</p>

<p>“There is not a soul,” Sir Douglas replied, in low
tones. “Don’t cross me in this, Sholto; to your son I
would willingly give all I possess. Heaven grant he
may derive greater happiness from it than I have done!”</p>

<p>There was a silence between the two men; then the
squire said, gently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“You look worn and tired, Douglas. Must you leave
England again so soon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Sir Douglas returned briefly. “My search is
not ended; if nothing else will support me, revenge will.”
He paused for an instant, then went on quickly, “Sholto,
old fellow, don’t think me mad or wild; there is a spot in
my past which even you can never see. Only this much
I will tell you, that, though I am a cynical, dry, hard
creature now, there was a time, a brief heavenly time,
when my life was as full of joy and vigor as your son’s is
now. The memory of that dead joy, the memory of my
terrible wrong—for I was wronged—has destroyed my
life’s happiness. I live only for two things—to be revenged
and to be satisfied.”</p>

<p>He rose from his chair as he spoke, and strode rapidly
up and down the room, while the squire watched him tenderly
and sorrowfully. He read the depth of trouble in
the grief-distorted face; but he did not seek to know this
or learn in any way the truth of his cousin’s strange career.
Sir Douglas suddenly stopped in his hurried walk.</p>

<p>“I am not myself to-day, Sholto,” he said, relapsing
into his dry manner. “My return to your old home,
where everything speaks of the past, has worked badly on
me; but the weakness is gone, and—don’t be alarmed—it
will not come again.”</p>

<p>The squire said nothing, but stretched out his hand and
grasped his cousin’s in silence. Sir Douglas turned away
as their fingers unloosened and threw himself into his
chair again.</p>

<p>“I shall stay with you for a week or two, Sholto,” he
went on, presently. “I want to make friends with Stuart—and
then I shall disappear. I trust your wife will
not be alarmed at my rough appearance; I believe I have
some decent coats among my things—I must look them
out.”</p>

<p>“Constance will welcome you warmly,” though he
shifted his papers nervously about as he spoke.</p>

<p>“More especially when she knows what has brought
me,” was Sir Douglas’ muttered thought.</p>

<p>Then he turned the conversation on other things; and
the two men were soon lost in an argument, talking as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
easily and naturally as though fifteen days, not years, had
elapsed since their last meeting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, away in the Weald grounds, the picnic was
progressing well. Margery had spread her snow-white
cloth on the turf and placed the dainty cakes and apples
upon it; and, despite Stuart’s grumbling, he ate heartily
of the simple repast.</p>

<p>“I call this heavenly!” he exclaimed, as he lay on the
grass, leaning on his elbow, and watched Margery feed
the dogs.</p>

<p>“It is nice,” she agreed, turning her great sapphire eyes
on him; “but I do all the work and you picnic, Mr.
Stuart. I am afraid you are very lazy.”</p>

<p>“I know I am,” confessed the young man, “but you
forget how hard I have always worked, Margery,” he
added.</p>

<p>Margery shook her wealth of red-gold hair, and
laughed a sweet, musical laugh that rang through the
summer silence.</p>

<p>“Worked,” she repeated—“you worked! I don’t believe
you really know what work means.”</p>

<p>“I do seem to have led a purposeless life when I think
of it,” Stuart observed, reflectively. “The hardest day
I ever had was when I went tiger-shooting.”</p>

<p>“Tiger-shooting!” repeated the girl, paling. “Oh,
Mr. Stuart, it sounds so dreadful!”</p>

<p>“You are a little coward, Margery,” Stuart laughed.
“By Jove, though, how you would have enjoyed some of
the things I did! I am sure you would be a good sailor.
Margery, how would you like to be out at sea and not a
speck of land in sight?”</p>

<p>“I have read of the sea; but I have never seen it,” Margery
said, simply. “But I think I should like it; there
must be such a grandeur and beauty in rolling waves and
great moving waters. I wish you would tell me something
about it, Mr. Stuart.”</p>

<p>Stuart moved into a sitting position and leaned his
back against the trunk of a giant tree.</p>

<p>“I shall have to write a book about my travels, and
dedicate it to you,” he said, lightly.</p>

<p>Margery smiled, and then put her arm round the collie’s
neck, and drew the dog’s head on to her knees. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
retriever had retired to a shady spot, and was stretched
out fast asleep. Stuart launched at once into anecdotes
of the sea; he knew just where to put a telling touch and
wake the interest; and Margery listened eagerly, drinking
in the wonders with pretty incredulity and making
Stuart break into hearty fits of laughter at her ignorant
nautical remarks.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed quickly; the sun had moved
round, and cast slanting rays of golden light into the
green nook. It touched Margery’s head, seeming to rest
on the soft silky curls with delight. She looked so
sweet in her plain white gown—a very flower of purity
and beauty—that Stuart’s eyes, resting on her, would
make him hesitate in his story and his heart thrill with a
strong wave of unspeakable pleasure. To Margery the
moments slipped away too quickly; she reveled in these
tales of strange countries, in the adventures and hair-breadth
escapes that had filled those two years of travel.</p>

<p>“How beautiful and how strange it must have been,
Mr. Stuart!” she said, drawing a deep breath, after a
while. “You must find Hurstley dull.”</p>

<p>“Hurstley to me is the most beautiful place in the
whole world,” Stuart said, involuntarily. “I love it.”</p>

<p>“And so do I!” cried the girl. “But then I am different.”
There was a slight pause, and she went on thinking
of what he had just told her. “Then I was wrong
when I said you had not worked—why, you helped to
save the ship that stormy night, Mr. Stuart!”</p>

<p>Stuart smiled as he moved nearer and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“There is the mark of the cut from one of the ropes.
Now, you will give me credit for some good, Margery?”</p>

<p>The girl took the hand between her own two small
brown ones. She bent her head to look at the scar, while,
at the touch of her fingers, Stuart felt his whole being
thrill and the last barrier that stood between himself and
his love melt away.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, I see,” Margery said, gently. “Oh, Mr.
Stuart, what pain you must have suffered!”</p>

<p>She raised her luminous eyes to him, their blue depths
darkened almost to blackness at the thought of that terrible
night at sea, and met the steady, passionate gaze bent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
on her. Some new sense flooded her mind; in one second
all her girlish innocence vanished; she knew that she was
on the brink of a great wondrous event, though she could
not guess what it was. She dropped Stuart’s hand, and
rose hurriedly.</p>

<p>“It is getting late; we must go,” she declared.
“Mother will want me.”</p>

<p>Stuart at once moved to her side. He took the sunbonnet
from her hand, and imprisoned the small fingers
within his own.</p>

<p>“Margery,” he said, softly, “is mother the only one who
wants you? Will you not stay with me? Ah, my darling,”
he cried, bending to catch her other hand and seeing
the trembling lips and great, wondrous, startled eyes,
“I have frightened you! You do not know—how could
you?—how much you have become to me. Margery, I
did not mean to speak yet—I meant to wait, and let your
love grow; but your sweet face has urged me, and I can
wait no longer. Margery, my own darling, I love you!
Do you love me?”</p>

<p>Margery felt herself drawn into his strong arms. She
looked up at him for one instant, then said softly:</p>

<p>“Love! What is love?”</p>

<p>“Love,” cried Stuart, “is the greatest joy or the greatest
pain. To love is to think, dream, live only for one
person, to be happy when near them, lonely when away,
ever longing to clasp their hand, listen to their voice, as I
have done these past weeks, my own sweet dear one.”</p>

<p>“Then”—the color came vividly into the cream-white
cheeks, the eyelids drooped, and the graceful head was
bent—“then I do love you, Mr. Stuart; but——”</p>

<p>“But!” interrupted Stuart, gathering her to his arms.
“There is no ‘but,’ my darling, my very own! Oh, Margery,
if you could know what happiness I feel! It is
such peace after doubt and perplexity. See—just now
you threw my hand away; I give it to you again, my
darling, yours to defend and tend you when you are my
wife.”</p>

<p>“Your wife!” faltered Margery; and she trembled—the
suddenness, the sweetness of this news seemed to have
taken all strength from her. She lived in an indescribable
dream of happiness; Stuart’s arms were round her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
his eyes gazed into hers, his voice was whispering tenderly
in her ear. She could not then grasp the full extent
of her joy, she was dazed by the passion and depths of his
love.</p>

<p>“Yes, my wife, thank Heaven!” said Stuart, reverently
raising one small hand to his lips.</p>

<p>“Margery, each day that has gone has linked me closer
to you—try as I would, my love would turn to you.
There may be storms in life before us,” he went on, hurriedly,
involuntarily drawing the slender form closer to
him as he thought of his mother’s anger—“there may be
trials, battles to fight; but we will be firm and trust in
each other. If we have love, we shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“My love will never, never die,” Margery murmured
slowly, drawing herself out of his arms. “But it is all so
strange—you to love me! And—ah, what will madame
say, Mr. Stuart? I don’t know why, but I am sure she
does not like me.”</p>

<p>“Margery”—and Stuart drew her back to him again
and kissed her sweet lips—“we are pledged to each other,
and none shall part us. Leave all to me, and it will
come right. And now I have a lesson to teach you—henceforth
I am Stuart, and Stuart only; don’t forget.”</p>

<p>“I will not,” she promised. She was silent for an instant,
then said, softly: “How good you are! I will try
to be worthy of you. Something tells me, Stuart, that I
am not a common village girl. You will know the truth,
perhaps, some day, and then you will be proud of me.”</p>

<p>“I shall never be prouder of you than I am now!”
cried the young man, fervently. “I care not what you
are—I love you; you shall be my wife!”</p>

<p>Margery raised her lovelit eyes, eloquent in tenderness,
to his, and then smiled.</p>

<p>“Our picnic is ended,” she said, loosing herself from
his hold and picking up her sunbonnet; “the dogs are
tired of waiting; we must go.”</p>

<p>Stuart watched her pack her basket and tie on the
simple headgear, his heart throbbing with pure passionate
love. Henceforth, let come what might, this girl belonged
to him—she was his very own.</p>

<p>“Margery,” he said, as they stood together before
starting, “this is the birth of our happiness. Remember,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
my darling, that you now are my life, my very soul. If
clouds should gather, turn to me and I will sweep them
away.”</p>

<p>Margery rested her hand for one moment on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Stuart,” she said, steadily, “I was a girl an hour ago—I
am a woman now. As you love me, dear, so I love
you, and ever shall, though a world should stretch between
us.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>The sun was growing ruddy in its glory, filling the
heavens with a radiant, beautiful light. Margery had
parted with Stuart at the Weald gate, and, urged by the
wonder and fullness of her happiness, she turned back
again to the spot henceforth engraved on her memory
with a golden touch. She stood beneath the tree that
had reared its branches over her unconscious head
through the past hours, and her heart thrilled again and
again at the thought of the marvelous treasure that had
come to her. Stuart Crosbie loved her—loved her—Margery
Daw—a girl without even a name to call her
own! She covered her eyes with her hands, as if to
shield them from the memory of his passionate glances.
What had she ever done to deserve this happiness? Had
not her soul murmured often, fretted beneath the cloud
of mystery that hung over her? Ah, how wrong she had
been! Even while she had murmured, a gift was coming
to her, a gift beside which all else faded away and
vanished. A sudden impulse moved the girl. She was
alone; save for the occasional note of the birds, the faint
flutter of the leaves, there was not a sound to break the
silence. On the very spot where she had stood when
Stuart uttered his earnest, fervent vows she knelt and
sent up words of thankfulness. Then she sank upon the
ground and, nestling close to the tree, let her fancy wander
to the future. She felt at times as if she could not
be the Margery of the morning—so far away now—and
she almost doubted whether it was not all a dream, till a
sudden recollection of her lover’s voice—the memory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
his words—returned, and she knew it was a blissful
reality.</p>

<p>The minutes slipped away, and it was not till the chiming
of a distant clock fell on her ear that Margery began
to realize how long she had sat and how late it was. She
rose hurriedly and made her way through the wood to
the path. She had her secret to whisper to the poor,
sick mother at home, and the thought lent speed to her
feet. What joy she would bring to that tender heart!
What happiness to share her new delights with such a
one!</p>

<p>She ran down the hill, the ripple of the stream sounding
in her ears like music, and approached the garden
gate. A lady was seated in the cottage doorway, and, as
Margery was hurrying up the path, she rose and came
to meet her.</p>

<p>“Miss Lawson!” exclaimed Margery, in surprise.</p>

<p>“I have been waiting here nearly an hour,” the governess
returned; “your mother has been extremely unwell,
and——”</p>

<p>“Mother ill!” exclaimed Margery, with a sudden pang.
“Oh, let me go to her!”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson put a detaining hand upon the girl’s
arm.</p>

<p>“You must not disturb her; she has just dropped off
to sleep. Reuben has gone to fetch Dr. Metcalf, and
Mrs. Carter is sitting indoors to see to her.”</p>

<p>Margery’s face had grown very sad.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, in a low voice. “She was
weak when I left her to-day, but not more than usual.”</p>

<p>“She had a severe fit of coughing, and it brought on
an attack of the hemorrhage again; it has stopped now,
but it has left her very weak. You can do nothing just
now, Margery, and I came purposely to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson was a small, thin woman with a quiet,
determined face, which from long contact with the world
had grown almost stern; but there were gleams of
warmth and kindliness from the clear, gray eyes and a
touch even of tenderness about the mouth sometimes.
Now, though she spoke in her keen, dry way, there was
an expression of kindness, almost affection, on her features<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
as she looked at Margery. The girl turned back
from the door at once.</p>

<p>“Shall I bring you a chair here, Miss Lawson?” she
asked, quietly—this news of her mother’s illness had
fallen as a cloud on the brilliancy of her joy.</p>

<p>“No. Come outside and stroll part of the way home
with me,” said Miss Lawson. “I have something of importance
to say to you—indeed, I have wanted to speak
to you for several days past; but I had nothing very
definite in my mind at the time. To-day I have.”</p>

<p>Margery followed the rectory governess down the path
in silence.</p>

<p>“Margery,” began Miss Lawson, abruptly, “have you
ever thought about your future? Have you ever thought
what will become of you when Mary Morris dies?”</p>

<p>The flush called up by the first sentence died away
quickly, and Margery’s face paled. She put her hand
suddenly to her heart.</p>

<p>“Is she going to die so soon?” she murmured, involuntarily.
“Oh, Miss Lawson, you do not think she will die
soon?”</p>

<p>“It is impossible to say,” returned the elder woman,
quietly. “Mrs. Morris has been gradually sinking all
this summer; she may linger for months, or she may pass
away at any moment. It is not her present illness that
has caused me to speak; as I tell you, I have intended
doing so for days past. I have considered it my duty to
put matters clearly before you.”</p>

<p>She paused for an instant. Margery’s face was
pained and sad; her heart was heavy with sorrow and
dread; all sunshine seemed suddenly to have gone from
her life, and, for the moment, Stuart, her lover, was
forgotten.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will think me harsh,” Miss Lawson went
on, “when I say that I consider it time you began to
plan your future life. Remember, you are now about
seventeen, and in another year—indeed, now—should
take upon yourself the responsibilities of life. Hitherto
you have been tended and cared for by two women.
Lady Coningham has opened her purse generously, poor
Mary Morris has lavished the wealth of her whole heart
on you; but now, when she is taken from you, you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
have but Lady Coningham to fall back upon; and, unless
I judge you wrongly, I think you will grow weary of
your dependence and long to be free. Don’t think me
unkind, child,” continued Miss Lawson, putting a hand
on the girl’s slender shoulder. “If I did not like you so
much—if I did not know the good in your nature—I
should not speak so plainly. But you must review your
position. You are grown now almost to womanhood;
you are educated above the level of many a girl of
wealthier station; you have natural gifts that will aid
you; and I say distinctly, you should shake yourself free,
not with ingratitude, but with a sense of duty and independence.
Believe me, Margery, in the long run you
will be far happier.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right,” the girl assented. She had followed
each word and grasped the meaning instantly.
Her natural pride was roused in one moment, and she
felt a thrill of desire to add no more to her heavy debt
of kindness—to be indeed free.</p>

<p>“Understand me—you must not turn suddenly and be
selfishly murmuring over the past,” urged Miss Lawson,
who had been closely watching the girl. “Whatever
happens, be grateful, Margery.”</p>

<p>“I am—I am,” cried Margery, “thankful to all, and to
you, for you have done so much for me, and now you
come to help me again!”</p>

<p>“As I shall always help you, I hope,” returned the
governess. “I knew you would understand me, Margery—I
felt you would be true to your nature. I waited only
till I had something definite to propose before I spoke to
you.” She drew out a letter from her pocket as she
finished. “You have heard me speak of my sister, Mrs.
Fothergill. This is from her. She has married a doctor
in London, a man who is fast becoming celebrated as a
specialist. I have written many times about you, and,
when we have met, I have chatted to her, till she thoroughly
realizes what you are. This letter came only
this morning, and it contains something that I thought
would just suit you.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Margery, simply.</p>

<p>Miss Lawson unfolded the letter.</p>

<p>“‘You have often heard me mention Lady Enid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Walsh,’” she read, “‘the poor young creature whom
John has been attending during the past year. I was sitting
with her yesterday. She seems to have taken a
fancy to me, and during our conversation she asked me
to help her to find a companion. She has a lady with
her now, an officer’s widow; but she is not a pleasant
woman, and they are going to part. I feel so sorry for
Lady Enid—young, with beauty and rank, and a cripple
for life! She leads such an isolated existence!—for her
aunt, Lady Merivale, at whose house she resides, is very
old, and almost always confined to her room, and Lady
Enid’s only brother, the Earl of Court, is never in England.
She welcomes me so warmly, and opens her heart
to me! She told me that she would like a bright young
girl for companion—if possible from the country. Lady
Enid adores the country; but she is compelled to live in
London to be near the doctors and under the so-called
care of her aunt. Immediately she spoke of a country
girl my thoughts flew to your pupil, Margery Daw.
From your accounts I feel sure she is the very person
to suit the poor young invalid. Do you think this could
be managed? She would have a luxurious home, a really
magnificent salary, and I feel sure would soon grow to
love Lady Enid—no one could help doing so. I half
said I knew of some one, and she adopted the idea
eagerly; so I hasten to write you.</p>

<p>“‘The question is whether Margery would like the life.
It would be dull, very dull; but Lady Enid is a most
charming and intellectual companion, and very unselfish.
I know you have been anxious about your pupil; and this
seems such a wonderful chance that I cannot help saying
I shall be disappointed if it falls through. I suppose
Lady Coningham would not object to her <i>protégée’s</i> becoming
independent? Write by return, and let me know
what you think of my proposal; and, if you approve, try
to arrange it as quickly as possible, as the widow lady
leaves in a fortnight.’”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson folded the letter slowly, and put it back
into her pocket.</p>

<p>“That is all,” she said, quietly. “Now, Margery, it
remains for you to express your feelings.”</p>

<p>“It is so sudden,” responded Margery, faintly; her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
hands were clasped together; her face, hidden behind the
flopping sunbonnet, was perplexed, pained and troubled.</p>

<p>What must she do? How could she leave Hurstley,
where every tree and stone was precious to her, and
where her heart was bound? Should she speak openly
of her love at once, her future marriage with the young
squire of Crosbie Castle? The words were on her lips—and
then she hesitated. Instinctively she felt that Miss
Lawson would not approve of the engagement, and she
vividly recalled madame’s unceasing dislike. No, she
could not speak of it yet; it was so new, so strange;
perhaps, after all, it might not be—and her hands pressed
her heart closely. She would leave all to him; he must
speak out, she could not. And what, then, must she say
to this proposal? Could she leave Hurstley—go from
the sun which gave her being life, into a lonely, strange
world—leave all that she knew and loved so well—the
tiny cottage, the sweet-smelling woods and lanes, and
the poor, sick woman, a mother in all but truth? That
last thought came as a golden gleam.</p>

<p>“Mother!” she said, hurriedly, “I cannot leave her.”</p>

<p>“Then you renounce all thought of independence,” she
observed, coldly, watching the girl’s face with something
like a frown on her own.</p>

<p>“I do not,” replied Margery, firmly. “I have listened
to your advice, and I will take it; but I must first think
of her. She will miss me, Miss Lawson—I know she
will.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Miss Lawson, after a pause, “that is true.
It would be cruel to leave her now. I will write to my
sister and thank her in your name, and explain why
you refuse.”</p>

<p>“You are not cross with me?” Margery murmured, putting
out her hand suddenly.</p>

<p>“Cross? No, my child. I wish it might have been
arranged; but you are right; it is your duty to stay with
Mary Morris, and help to cheer her sad life. In the
future, if ever you want help, come to me, and what I can
do I will.”</p>

<p>Margery’s eyes met the governess’ steady gaze, and
then she bent forward and kissed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“I will come to you,” she said, simply; and the two
women separated.</p>

<p>Margery hurried down the hill toward home. She felt
weary, almost exhausted; it had been a day of extreme
mental excitement. As she passed the woods and the
stream, her thoughts went back to Stuart, and she felt
again the power of his love. Why should she have
doubted him? Why not have spoken bravely of their
love? Had he not said himself that storms might come,
but he would face them all? To-morrow she would seek
Miss Lawson, and, strong in the knowledge of Stuart’s
great, honest heart, tell her all. Now she must hasten
to the sick woman, and watch beside her with tender care
and hope.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Stuart Crosbie strode home to the castle, feeling that
he had left behind him everything that made life happy.
His love for Margery had been growing slowly, but
surely, during the past three months that had elapsed
since his return home. Her beauty bewitched and enthralled
him, her freshness and sweetness linked him
still more strongly, her daintiness and natural refinement
appealed to him through all. He knew there would be
trouble; that his mother would denounce his choice; but
his mind was made up, his will, the will of which she was
so proud herself, would be firm as iron. Let all the world
rage, Margery should be his wife. Though she was
nameless, a waif, a nobody, was she not a pure, sweet
girl? Were these worldly considerations stains on her
fair character? No; his heart was given, his mind made
up, and nothing should move him. He raised his head
proudly at this thought, a look of determination on his
face. He was armed for the fray; but, while he gloried
in his own strength, there came the thought of Margery’s
weakness. Would she brave the storm as he could?
Would not the bitterness of his mother’s anger wound
and humiliate her? His face softened. He must shield
his sweet love from the fierceness of the battle, tenderly
protect her from the cruel wind of harshness and coldness
that would most assuredly greet her at Crosbie
Castle.</p>

<p>He chose the path through the paddock, and walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
through the courtyard just as the tower clock chimed a
quarter to eight. He had but a few minutes to change his
tennis suit for his dinner garb, and he ran hurriedly from
the coachhouse round to the lawn, determined to make a
rush to his room. He dismissed his dog with a word,
sped fleetly across the grounds till he reached the colonnade,
and entered it, when suddenly, by some mischance,
his foot slipped. He made a vain effort to save himself;
his head swum; he was conscious of a sudden sharp
twinge of pain, and, falling heavily, he knew no more.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sir Douglas Gerant, after a lengthened chat with his
cousin, mounted to his room, and dressed himself with
due regard for the exigencies of polite society. The hard,
cynical look that had rested on his face during his conversation
with Vane Charteris, and in the political argument
with the squire, had now vanished. He looked
worn and ill as he walked slowly up and down his room;
his eyes were sad; his head drooped. He seemed to be
thinking deeply; at last, with a deep-drawn sigh, he
seated himself at the table and wrote a letter. It was a
summons to his lawyer, bidding him draw up a will, and
fixing a day for him to come to Crosbie Castle. This
done, Sir Douglas leaned back in his chair and covered
his eyes with his hand for several minutes. The entrance
of his valet, a man who had been his faithful servant and
companion for years, roused him; and, bidding the valet
dispatch the letter quickly, Sir Douglas left his room and
descended the broad staircase. As he passed through the
wide hall to the colonnade, its white pillars, gleaming
against the background of green, tinged now with the
ruddy gold of the setting sun, made a picture gratifying
to his artistic eye. He sauntered on, determining to seek
the grounds, when his eyes fell on Stuart’s prostrate form
and pale face. In an instant he was kneeling beside the
young man, and his clear voice rang out to the butler, who
happened to be passing to the dining-room.</p>

<p>The man hurried up with some brandy, and Sir Douglas,
with almost professional dexterity, lifted Stuart’s
head and poured a few drops between the closed lips. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
watched the color slowly return, and the eyes open, with
a look of anxiety and tenderness on his face.</p>

<p>“That is right!” he said, gently, as he met Stuart’s
gaze. “Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“My arm!” murmured the young man, faintly, as the
butler and Sir Douglas helped him to rise.</p>

<p>The baronet cast a keen glance at the right hand, hanging
limp and swollen.</p>

<p>“You have had an ugly fall,” he said, briefly. “Your
arm is broken—how did it happen?”</p>

<p>He pushed Stuart gently into a chair near at hand, and,
while he spoke, he deftly cut away the slight tennis sleeve
from the wounded limb with a pair of scissors taken from
his pocket.</p>

<p>“I can’t quite remember,” Stuart replied, speaking with
an effort, and passing his left hand over his eyes. “I
came an awful cropper, I know, and must have banged
my head. Is the arm broken? If so, you had better send
for Metcalf and have it set.”</p>

<p>The butler was moving away; but Sir Douglas stopped
him.</p>

<p>“There is no need to send to the village—I can manage
this. Go up to my room and send down my man; it is
not the first time he has helped me in this sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Stuart lay back in his chair; he was still feeling faint
and weak. He caught Sir Douglas’ eye, and smiled a
little.</p>

<p>“I feel rather like what the boys used to call a ‘jolly
duffer,’” he said, slowly. “I can’t think what made me
so stupid; I don’t usually fall about in this way. I wonder
how long I was insensible—and I have never thanked
you for helping me.” Stuart was gradually recovering
himself, and woke to the fact that this was a stranger.
“I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>“It is granted, Cousin Stuart.”</p>

<p>Stuart looked mystified, and then said, suddenly putting
out his left hand:</p>

<p>“You are Douglas Gerant; I am very glad to see you.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas grasped the hand.</p>

<p>“Thanks, my lad,” he said, quietly; then, looking round:
“Here is Murray. Now sit quiet, and don’t speak, and
we’ll settle you in a trice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Stuart watched his cousin curiously as he prepared the
bandages and improvised some splints; he scarcely felt
the long, white fingers as they moved over his wounded
arm, and winced only as the bones clicked together. But
he grew fainter as the bandages were wound round; and,
as the operation was finished, Sir Douglas, without a
word, held the brandy to his lips again and forced him to
drink some.</p>

<p>“You have pluck, Stuart,” he said, quietly. “You are
of the stuff to make a man. Now, if you take my advice,
you will go to your room and rest. I fancy that arm will
trouble you rather to-night; so try to get some sleep
now.”</p>

<p>“My head feels rather queer, I confess,” Stuart responded;
and he gladly let his cousin draw his hand
through his arm and lead him through the hall to the
stairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie was sailing down as they approached.</p>

<p>“Stuart,” she exclaimed, in genuine dismay, “what is
the matter?”</p>

<p>“He has fallen and broken his arm,” Sir Douglas answered,
quietly. “I am taking him to his room; it will be
wiser to let him pass, Cousin Constance, as he has had a
nasty touch on the head.”</p>

<p>“Arm broken!” cried Mrs. Crosbie, in alarm. “But it
must be set! I will send for Dr. Metcalf at once!”</p>

<p>“You can send for the doctor, if you like,” Sir Douglas
remarked, as he drew Stuart up the stairs; “but his arm
is already set. I have had considerable experience in such
cases, and I can assure you it is all right.”</p>

<p>Stuart smiled faintly at his mother, and she followed
him up the stairs, a little annoyed, a little anxious, and,
oddly enough, a little glad—annoyed because Sir Douglas
had taken so much upon himself; anxious for her son,
whom she loved better than anything on earth; and glad,
because she saw in this illness a chance of bringing about
the marriage between Vane and Stuart, which she so
much desired.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas left the mother and son together when he
had ensconced his patient comfortably in a large chair;
and Mrs. Crosbie busied herself with many little offices
about the room, quitting the apartment only when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
saw Stuart’s eyes close in slumber. She met Vane on the
landing, and, with an affectionate glance, drew the girl’s
hand through her arm.</p>

<p>“He is resting, dear,” she said, “so I shall leave him
for a while. We must nurse him together, and we shall
soon get him well.”</p>

<p>Vane’s face flushed a little.</p>

<p>“I will help you gladly,” she returned, and she spoke
honestly. Her first thought, like her aunt’s, had been
that this would bring Stuart and herself more together.
She had another duty to perform, too. She must ingratiate
herself with Sir Douglas Gerant, and try by
every means in her power to wipe away the memory of
her foolish mistake.</p>

<p>Stuart slept for an hour or two, and dreamed of Margery,
but when he awoke the pain in his arm was so great
that even her sweet image was banished from his
thoughts. His mother came in as night fell, but Stuart
was too ill to broach the subject of his love. The blow
on the head was more severe than he had imagined, and
he grew feverish as the day declined. He heard the tower
clock chime the night hours, and whenever he moved his
head, his eyes rested on the figure of Sir Douglas reading
by the window, and ready at any moment to tend him.</p>

<p>And at the small cottage by the Weald another being
sat and watched by a sickbed, watched with a heart that
was growing sadder and sadder as the moments passed.
Margery, still in the white cotton gown that she wore
when she plighted her troth, knelt by Mary Morris’
couch, trying to alleviate the pain that was racking the
poor, wasted frame. She was ignorant of her lover’s illness,
and she thought of him only with a sense of peace
and happiness. What a long, wonderful day it had been,
she thought, as she sat beside the little window and
watched the veil of night darken the sky—a day in which
her girlhood was buried forever, a day in which the
golden glory of all earthly happiness dawned for her!
She turned from the window to watch the sick woman.
The paroxysm of pain seemed past, and she was asleep.
The house was quiet as a tomb. In another room the
loving, faithful husband and companion was lost to
trouble in slumber. Margery was alone; she moved softly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
to the window and drew back the curtains, and immediately
the room was bathed in the silver radiance of the
moon.</p>

<p>She stood and gazed on at the dark-blue heavens, the
glittering myriads of jeweled stars, the moonlit earth, till
a cloud seemed to obscure her vision; and, when she
gazed again, the stars were gone and a ruddy haze,
pierced by the sun’s golden beams, illumined the sky.</p>

<p>She rose softly, moved on tiptoe to the bed, then, with
a sudden shudder, dropped on her knees beside it. While
her eyes had been closed in sleep, while the dawn had
spread its roseate veil over the night, a spirit had flown
from earth—Mary Morris was dead!</p>

</div>


<p>The days passed away, and Stuart Crosbie gradually
recovered from the effects of his fall. Despite the assurance
from Sir Douglas that her son was doing well, Mrs.
Crosbie satisfied herself and summoned the village doctor,
together with a fashionable physician from town, only to
receive the same opinion from them, coupled with the expression
that Stuart could not have been better treated.
The young man passed four days in his room; but, as the
pain left his head, he insisted on donning his clothes and
descending to the garden. His mind was haunted by
Margery’s image and the thought of her sorrow; for the
news of Mrs. Morris’ death had reached him through his
servant, and he longed to rush away and comfort his
darling. He had seen little of his mother during the past
four days; Sir Douglas had constituted himself head
nurse, and Mrs. Crosbie, who was not quite at home in a
sickroom, gave way to him with a little annoyance and
jealousy, though she would not let it be seen. Stuart
had not been sufficiently well, during the short time she
visited him, to speak about Margery—indeed, he scarcely
had strength to reply to her inquiries—the heat was still
very great, and, although he had an excellent constitution,
he was considerably weakened by the fever and pain.
But, though he could not collect his ideas to speak of
Margery, she was never absent from his thoughts. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
vision of her sweet blue eyes, her wistful, lovely face,
haunted his bedside, bringing a sense of peace and rest to
his troubled dreams.</p>

<p>At last, after four days had passed, Stuart insisted on
leaving his room and seeking the air, urged, in fact, by a
strong desire to see his mother and tell her of his love.
Sir Douglas offered no opposition to this move; the
severer effects of the fall were now passed, and, with such
health and vigor as Stuart possessed, his arm would soon
heal. Nevertheless, it was a rather shattered likeness of
the handsome cousin that greeted Vane Charteris’ eyes as
she crossed the hall and saw him making slow progress
down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Let me help you,” she said, gently, moving forward at
once, and putting out her hand.</p>

<p>“Thanks. I am rather shaky,” returned Stuart, smiling
faintly. “How do you do, Cousin Vane? Thanks for all
your kind messages.”</p>

<p>Vane made no reply, but helped him down the stairs,
across the hall to the colonnade, and, pushing forward a
large chair, she soon made him comfortable.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said again; “you are very kind. Is
my mother anywhere about?”</p>

<p>“She has gone to Chesterham on some missionary business,”
replied Vane, leaning back against one of the white
pillars, and looking extremely pretty and graceful in her
long, soft pink gown. “I don’t think she knew that you
were coming down, or I am sure she would not have
gone.”</p>

<p>Stuart sat silent, troubled and disappointed. He had
braced himself for his interview with his mother; he was
longing to send some word or sign to Margery. Four
whole, long days had passed since their picnic in the
wood, and during that time sorrow had come to her, and
he had not ministered to her comfort. He wondered
whether she knew of his illness, whether she realized that
it was that illness alone that had kept him silent. He had
determined, as he rose, to speak to his mother, and then
drive over to the Weald cottage and bring Margery back
in all dignity to the castle, as befitted his future wife; but
now again fate was unkind; his mother was absent—might
be absent the whole day—and he was too weak to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
crawl even to the carriage. What could he do? He must
send some message of comfort, some word of love to
Margery. His eyes fell on his maimed hand; and, with a
half groan, he realized that he was helpless, utterly helpless
to do as he wished.</p>

<p>Vane Charteris watched him carefully. She saw his
brow contract and the look of trouble gather on his face.</p>

<p>“Are you in pain?” she asked, gently.</p>

<p>Stuart woke from his musings.</p>

<p>“My arm is a little troublesome,” he replied, evasively;
then, collecting his thoughts with an effort, he said:
“But I must not be selfish, Vane. You will find it dull
work sitting with an invalid. I feel so angry with myself
for being so clumsy. Just fancy, Vane—this is the
first time I have been ill in my life!”</p>

<p>“Then we must do our best to cheer you, Cousin
Stuart,” Vane responded, a faint color mounting to her
cheeks at the last words. What could they mean but that
this illness kept him from her side? “Come,” she added,
brightly—“let me amuse you, read to you, or do something.
I assure you, Cousin Stuart, I consider it a
pleasure. I would do anything for you, believe me.”</p>

<p>Stuart looked at her as she drew up another chair and
sunk into it, giving him a frank, affectionate glance. A
sudden thought flashed into his mind, and then died
away.</p>

<p>“You look upon me as useless,” she observed, with a
smile. “I mean to upset that theory altogether.”</p>

<p>“Useless!” echoed Stuart. “Indeed, Vane, you are
quite wrong.”</p>

<p>“Then let me help you,” Vane said, suddenly. “I see
plainly, Stuart, something is troubling you; it is not only
the arm. Come—I shall begin to be jealous of Sir
Douglas, to be afraid that you will trust in no one but
him. Will you not let me be your friend as well as your
cousin?”</p>

<p>Stuart half rose in his chair.</p>

<p>“My friend!” he repeated; then he sunk back again.
“Yes, Vane, if you will be my friend.”</p>

<p>“Friendship is not an empty term with me,” Miss Charteris
observed, slowly. “Since you will let me be your
friend, I must act as such. See”—extending her hand—“let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
us seal the contract—look upon me as your chum,
your sister, as well as your friend and cousin.”</p>

<p>Stuart grasped her hand.</p>

<p>“I will,” he said, quietly; “for I am in urgent need of
a friend, especially just now.”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at her; she was watching him
with an expression of frankness and sympathy.</p>

<p>“Vane,” he began slowly, “I came down this morning
on purpose to talk to my mother on a subject that is more
than life to me. I anticipate—I know—I shall have a
hard struggle with her, though, despite all she may say,
I shall be firm. Will you help me in this struggle?”</p>

<p>Vane rose to her feet again; her breath was coming
fast, and a presentiment of something disagreeable passed
through her mind.</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is, Stuart,” she said, quietly, unfurling
a large fan she carried, and holding it against the
light, ostensibly to shield her face from the sun, in reality
to keep it hidden from her cousin.</p>

<p>“Vane, do you remember the fourth day of your visit
here, when I took you to see Sir Charles?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Do you remember a girl who was sitting in a corner
and who brought me some water for the dog? I introduced
her—Margery Daw.”</p>

<p>Vane caught Stuart’s eager glance, and her heart
seemed to cease beating.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, a little coldly.</p>

<p>“Vane, that is my secret; that is the girl I love better
than any one or anything in the world—Margery Daw.”</p>

<p>Vane Charteris was silent for a moment. She felt as
though her vexation and jealousy would choke her; then
she forced herself to be firm and calm. She dropped her
fan and moved out of the sunlight; her face was very
pale, but she smiled as Stuart looked at her eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, quietly, “and—and you want me to
help you—how?”</p>

<p>“You will?” he asked, with gladness on his face.</p>

<p>Vane put one hand on her chair for support.</p>

<p>“Am I not your friend?” she smiled, faintly.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you—thank you!” he cried, rising from
his chair; but Vane gently pushed him back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me what you want,” she urged, standing at his
side, so that he could not see her pallor and annoyance.</p>

<p>“I want you to plead with me to my mother—not for
myself—I am strong enough”—and Stuart drew himself
up proudly—“I would face the whole world. I want you
to be a friend to Margery, as you would be to me. She
may need your help; a woman such as you, Vane, can do
much—smooth many difficulties. You can see how angry
my mother will be. I shall not care for her anger; but
Margery is so tender, so sweet, so proud—anger will humiliate
and distress her; and, if you aid her, she will
scarcely feel it, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Then you have not spoken to Aunt Constance yet?”
Vane observed, very quietly. “I am afraid you will have
great trouble. You see, Stuart, your—your wife
will be of low station, and your mother is proud.”</p>

<p>“We do not know what Margery’s birth may be; but
that does not affect me. I love her; she shall be my
wife. Ah, you do not know her, Cousin Vane, or you
would not have said that! There may be some mystery
connected with her birth; but there is no stain on her.
If ever there was a lady, she is one.”</p>

<p>“Your news has surprised me, Stuart, I must confess,”
observed Miss Charteris, moving languidly from his side
and sinking into her chair again; “but I shall prove my
words. I am your friend—I will act as such. Yes; I
will help you.”</p>

<p>Stuart’s face flushed, and he leaned forward and bent
his lips to Vane’s white hand.</p>

<p>“This is, indeed, good of you!” he exclaimed. “Vane,
I can never thank you enough.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what I must do,” returned Miss Charteris,
unfurling her fan again.</p>

<p>“Will you see Margery?” inquired Stuart, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“To-day?” asked Vane.</p>

<p>“Yes. Ah, Vane, think—four days have gone, she has
had a great sorrow, and I have been tied to my bed, not
able to see her, not even to write her a word! If you
would go to her, tell her all is going well, that you will
be her friend, you will make me so happy.”</p>

<p>“I will go, Stuart,” Vane said, quietly; “for your sake
I will do all I can. No; do not thank me. Remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
what I said just now—I would do anything for you. I
will wait till it is a little cooler, then borrow Aunt Constance’s
ponies, and drive to the village.” She hesitated.
“Perhaps—perhaps Miss Daw may not like me?”</p>

<p>“Not like you!” cried Stuart, quickly. “She cannot
help herself. Dear Vane, how good you are! You do
not know what a load you have taken off my mind. I
dreaded, I feared that my poor darling would have been
without a friend. Now she is secure. My mother loves
you, and will be led by you. I shall speak to her the instant
she returns, and then Margery can come here.
Vane, I shall never, never forget your kindness!”</p>

<p>“You shall give me all your messages before I start,”
Miss Charteris replied. “Now let me read to you a little—you
look tired. I shall not let you talk any more.”</p>

<p>She smiled gently, and flitted away, leaving Stuart deep
in happy thought. His spirits rose as the picture of a
blissful future floated before him, and his heart was filled
with gratitude toward Vane. Without her help, it would
have been a hard fight; but now his fears were lessened,
for his darling would have one stanch, true friend.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Gerant, walking through the hall, glanced
at the invalid lying back in the chair, his face illumined
with the flood of happiness that thrilled him.</p>

<p>“You look better, Stuart,” he said, abruptly, approaching
the young man.</p>

<p>“I am feeling splendid,” Stuart replied, heartily.</p>

<p>“Hum! What new remedy have you tried, may I
ask?” Sir Douglas said, dryly.</p>

<p>“A new doctor has prescribed for me,” Stuart said,
with a laugh; “and here she is. Cousin Vane, see how
much good you have done me! Sir Douglas has complimented
me with almost professional jealousy.”</p>

<p>Miss Charteris smiled, and, seating herself, opened her
book, while Sir Douglas retraced his steps through the
hall to the front entrance and walked thence across the
sweep of lawn to the lodge gates.</p>

<p>“So the wind blows in that quarter!” he mused, while
a frown contracted his brow. “I am sorry and disappointed.
He is a good lad, worthy of a better woman
than that proud, selfish creature. Well, I am an old fool!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
The sooner I go from here the better. I shall grow too
fond of Sholto’s son if I stay much longer.”</p>

<p>He walked briskly across the lawn, then turned into
the avenue, and approached the gates. The sun was
beating down on the hot, dusty lane, the lodge-keeper’s
wife was standing, her arms akimbo, talking to some one
leaning wearily against the iron pillar.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” she said, courtesying. “May I
make so bold as to ask how the young squire is this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Better—much better,” returned Sir Douglas.</p>

<p>“There, Margery—you hear?” the woman turned again
to the figure—“better. Lor’, if there ain’t that baby
awake! Excuse me, sir;” and, dropping a hasty courtesy,
Mrs. Clark rushed into the house.</p>

<p>“You have come to inquire after the young squire?”
Sir Douglas began, addressing the slender, black-robed
girl in kindly tones.</p>

<p>The head was bent, the plain skirt was thick with dust;
but there was about the young girl’s figure an air of unspeakable
grace, and a tress of the red-gold hair that
shone beneath the black straw hat gleamed as a touch of
wondrous color to the somber picture.</p>

<p>Margery raised her head.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” she replied, and then stopped, almost in
alarm. Sir Douglas had moved forward as his eyes
rested on her face; his color faded to a deathly whiteness,
and he almost staggered against the gate, his eyes still
fixed on her wondrous countenance.</p>

<p>“Who are you? What is your name?” he gasped,
rather than spoke.</p>

<p>“Margery Daw,” she answered, trembling a little with
fear. Then, seeing his head droop, she added quickly:
“You are ill, sir; let me get you some water.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas put out a feeble hand.</p>

<p>“It is nothing—a spasm—the heat,” he muttered; then
he moved slowly to the lodge door and sunk upon the
bench outside. “The heat,” he muttered again, “and a
ghost of the past.”</p>

<p>Margery went into the cottage, and returned with a
glass of water. Sir Douglas took it from her and drank
it eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“I have frightened you, child,” he said, abruptly.
“Tell me”—he pressed one hand to his side—“you are
called Margery Daw. Your mother—what of her?”</p>

<p>“I have no mother,” Margery replied, and her lip trembled.
“I am alone.”</p>

<p>“You live here—have lived here always?” went on Sir
Douglas, quickly.</p>

<p>“All my life,” she answered.</p>

<p>He sank back in the seat again.</p>

<p>“It was but my thought,” he murmured; “and yet
how like, how like!”</p>

<p>“Are you better now?” asked Margery, gently.</p>

<p>“Yes, child—yes”—he paused a little—“but I shall go
no further.” He rose slowly, his eyes wandering now
and again to the girl’s face. “But you—you look tired—what
are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Walk back to the village,” Margery answered, with a
sigh and a wistful glance in the direction of the castle.
So much sorrow had come to her since that happy day in
Weald Wood that she seemed, indeed, faint and weary.
She longed to see Stuart, to send him a few words; but
her pride, her modesty, forbade it, and not until this
morning could she summon up courage to walk to the
lodge gates and inquire about him. She never doubted
his constancy, nor did she look for any message from
him. She knew of his suffering, and all her thought was
for him. She turned away now, with a graceful inclination
to Sir Douglas, and prepared to retrace her steps.</p>

<p>“You cannot walk yet—you are not rested,” he said,
sharply. “Sit down a while. This heat is enough to kill
you.”</p>

<p>Margery shook her head.</p>

<p>“Thank you; I must go. I only came to inquire after—after
Mr. Stuart.”</p>

<p>“He is in good hands,” Sir Douglas remarked, in his
dry, cynical way. “I set his arm; but his heart requires
another doctor, and his cousin has succeeded there. Ah,
the village will see a wedding before long, child, unless I
have lost my wits!” He was turning away when he suddenly
approached her once more. “I must see you
again,” he said, in a strange, husky voice. “You have
brought back a gleam of the past that was buried, touched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the spring of a secret that has never seen life. There is
a strange sense of hope within my heart—hope that I
thought dead, never to be revived. Child, whoever you
may be, remember that in the future, while I live, I will
be a friend to you, for you bear an angel’s face.”</p>

<p>He turned and walked away rapidly; but Margery had
neither heard nor understood what he meant. She was
repeating over and over again the words he had uttered
first; her heart grasped too clearly and terribly the meaning—a
wedding in the village, a wedding from the castle!
Stuart, her Stuart, the being who held her very
life, marry another—that fair, lovely woman who had
laughed her to scorn! The sunshine grew blood-red before
her eyes, for one instant she reeled, and then grasped
the doorpost for support. Then gradually she awoke to
the fullness of her pain and humiliation. Pride was
swelling in her heart; she seemed in that instant changed
from a girl of glowing, living hopes to a woman who
had tasted the bitterness of all earthly grief. She bent
her head and walked steadily down the lane, heedless of
the sun, heedless of the rough stones, heedless even of
madame’s presence, as she dashed past in her carriage.
She was oblivious of everything save her pain and trouble,
and the memory of her wasted love.</p>

<p>Vane Charteris closed abruptly the book she was reading.
She had commenced the quotation scarcely heeding
what she read, but the sense dawned upon her as she
reached the end. She colored faintly and looked up hurriedly,
then gave a sigh of relief. Soothed by the musical
monotony of her voice, Stuart had fallen into a doze,
and the last words had had no meaning for him.</p>

<p>Vane opened her fan and sat back; her eyes were fixed
on the lovely picture before her, but her thoughts were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
tumult of anger, vexation and jealousy. To find her
plans upset, her hope of power pass from her in the very
moment of its birth, was a bitter mortification. Her
short dream of ambition was broken, and for what? A
mere country girl, whose eyes had bewitched Stuart, and
whose charm had beguiled the passing hour. A feeling
of self-annoyance succeeded the vexation. Vane bit her
lip and tapped the ground with her foot. What had she
done? Promised to befriend and assist the very woman
who had pushed her aside. She was a fool, the proud
girl told herself, not to have laughed Stuart’s tale of love
to scorn. A few cold words might, perchance, have
checked the ardor of his flame. Now it was too late; she
had given her promise, and she must meet this woman.
A deeper flush spread over Vane’s cheeks.</p>

<p>She shut her fan quickly, and looked curiously at her
sleeping cousin. A thought had suddenly come into her
mind. After all, she had not been so foolish, for was she
not to meet Margery alone, with no other influence to
work against hers? Could she not so manage as to
rouse, say, if not the demon of jealousy, at least the spirit
of pride? The girl had pride, Vane was compelled to
admit—she had not forgotten Margery’s dignity that day
in the courtyard, nor the graceful <i>hauteur</i> and ease with
which she had moved away. Wordy warfare was not
unknown to Miss Charteris, and it would be strange, indeed,
if she could not plant some poisoned arrows in
this presumptuous country girl’s breast.</p>

<p>Stuart could not write a line—that was fortunate; he
would not be able to leave the castle for three or four
days at the least—that also was fortunate. Vane felt her
spirits rise again, and her hatred, fanned by piqued vanity
and jealousy, grew stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>Some vague thought of trouble seemed to come at that
moment to Stuart, for, on turning her head, she met his
open eyes fixed with an anxious look on her.</p>

<p>“You have had a delightful sleep,” she said, rising, and
moving toward him. “I am so glad!”</p>

<p>Stuart passed his left hand over his brow.</p>

<p>“How rude you must think me, Vane!” he murmured.
“Your voice sent me to sleep; but I have not slumbered
peacefully. My arm is a most annoying member.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“I feared you were suffering,” Vane answered, gently.
“Stuart, why not go back to your room again? I am sure
it will be wiser.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel a Hercules, certainly,” confessed Stuart.
“Who could think that four days would pull a fellow
down so low?” He rose slowly from his chair, then
added, suddenly. “But my mother! Vane! I must see
her to-day.”</p>

<p>“I am going to propose something,” Vane said, slowly,
as she drew his hand through her arm. “Let me speak
to Aunt Constance. Believe me, I shall do it far better
than you. You would probably be hurt at what she says,
and then you would both be angry. Now, if I speak,
Stuart, I, being an impartial person, shall be more calm
and collected. I will plead your cause well, and—don’t
think me vain—I think I shall succeed as I wish.”</p>

<p>Vane drew a quick breath. Stuart did not see the
transitory gleam of triumph that flashed from her eyes.</p>

<p>“I am your friend; you will trust me?” she added,
gently.</p>

<p>“Trust you? Yes, Vane; but it seems cowardly, unmanly,
not to plead for myself.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to win your mother’s consent? Yes,
of course you do? Then be assured, Stuart, that in my
hands you will be more certain of it than if you act for
yourself. See—here is your servant! Take my advice,
rest and be happy, and all will go well.”</p>

<p>“Vane,” began Stuart; but she stopped him.</p>

<p>“Do as I ask you,” she pleaded; and with a smile of
grateful thanks, Stuart retired to his room.</p>

<p>“All will go well—yes,” mused Vane, as she turned
back to the colonnade. “I see the end clearly now. I
must enlist Aunt Constance on my side, and the rest will
follow in due course. Margery Daw, your chance of
reigning at Crosbie Castle grows smaller and smaller.”</p>

<p>She mounted the stairs to her room, stopping on the
way to exchange a few words and embraces with her
mother, who was overjoyed to see her darling child so
well and happy.</p>

<p>Vane made a careful, simple toilet; she exchanged her
long pink gown for a dainty white cambrice, chose a large
white hat and gloves of a light tan shade, and, after bidding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
her maid place them in readiness, descended to the
hall just as her aunt arrived.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie was dismissing her groom with the ponies
when Vane interrupted.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, auntie, dear,” she said, lightly, “but may
I have the carriage this afternoon? I have an errand to
perform in the village.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie looked surprised for an instant; then she
said, affably:</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear. At what time shall Tims bring
it round?”</p>

<p>“About five o’clock. Many thanks, Aunt Constance,”
she added, prettily, as Mrs. Crosbie gave the desired order.</p>

<p>Luncheon progressed slowly and rather silently. Lady
Charteris chatted away to the squire, and Mrs. Crosbie
dilated in her proud, cold way upon mission work. Sir
Douglas ate and spoke little, while Vane discussed the
delicacies in silence.</p>

<p>Several times in the course of the meal she was struck
by the strange expression on Sir Douglas Gerant’s face;
there was a glow of animation, a look of eagerness that
surprised her, and she decided mentally that he was pondering
some great problem, when she saw his brows
darken and his jaw set with determination. She herself
had many momentous thoughts troubling her; but her
manner was placidly serene. She was awaiting her opportunity
to speak alone with Mrs. Crosbie, and thought
to effect her purpose immediately after luncheon.</p>

<p>In this, however, she was foiled; her aunt was claimed
by the housekeeper on account of domestic affairs, and it
was past four o’clock before she was liberated.</p>

<p>At last Vane saw her chance. She had seated herself
in the colonnade, which was a favorite lounge for the
whole house in summer-time, and from here she could
see all who came and went. To outward appearance she
was absorbed in her book; but in reality she was keenly
alive to everything passing around, listening for the first
tones of her aunt’s voice, and wondering during the moments
of her watch what was causing the struggle in
Sir Douglas Gerant’s breast as he walked to and fro beneath
the shade of the trees in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>Vane did not look up as she saw her aunt approach;
but she gave Mrs. Crosbie a smile when she addressed
her.</p>

<p>“So I hear, Vane, that you have been nursing Stuart,
and with good results. I have just met Andrews, and
he tells me his master has slept nearly all the afternoon;
he will soon recover, now, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, indeed,” said Vane, softly.</p>

<p>She pushed forward a chair as she spoke; then, as her
aunt sank into it, she said, quietly:</p>

<p>“Aunt Constance, I want to speak to you. I said before
luncheon that I had an errand to perform in the
village, but I did not say what that errand was. I will
tell you now.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I look curious, Vane?” laughed Mrs.
Crosbie, her handsome features wearing an air of satisfaction
and pleasure as her gaze rested on her niece.</p>

<p>“I am going to see Margery Daw,” Vane said, slowly,
letting her eyes wander across the sunlit lawn, but not
before she saw a look of surprise dawn on her aunt’s
face.</p>

<p>“See Margery Daw!” repeated Mrs. Crosbie. “Why,
Vane?”</p>

<p>“Because Stuart has asked me to go.”</p>

<p>“Stuart!” breathed his mother, half rising from her
chair. “What do you mean, Vane?”</p>

<p>“I mean, aunt, that Stuart loves Margery Daw, and
says he will make her his wife.”</p>

<p>For a time there was no reply from Mrs. Crosbie, and
Vane, turning, saw a heavy frown on her handsome face.</p>

<p>“You are jesting, of course, Vane?” she said, at last.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Aunt Constance, I am not,” returned Miss
Charteris, quietly. “My news surprises you?”</p>

<p>“Surprises!” repeated Mrs. Crosbie. “I fail to understand
you at all.”</p>

<p>Vane rose and knelt beside her aunt.</p>

<p>“Auntie, dear,” she said, gently, “you must not be hard
on poor Stuart. Recollect, he has eyes, and this girl is
beautiful. I have seen her, and love is——”</p>

<p>“Has he asked you to plead for him?” interrupted Mrs.
Crosbie, coldly.</p>

<p>“No; he told me his secret this morning, urged by I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
know not what,” and Vane let her eyes wander away
again. “Perhaps,” she went on, after a brief pause,
“some idea of the warm interest I must ever have in
him prompted him; but that I cannot tell. He spoke
openly to me, and asked me to be her friend as I was
his.”</p>

<p>A sneer curled Mrs. Crosbie’s lip.</p>

<p>“He evidently thought union was strength,” she remarked,
dryly.</p>

<p>“Aunt Constance, I will not hear your anger against
Stuart,” Vane said, quickly. “I—I am his friend,
and——” Her head drooped and her cheeks flushed.
Then she went on, hurriedly: “It is not his fault—of
that I am sure; you must blame Margery Daw, if you
blame any one.”</p>

<p>“Does he expect me to receive her?” asked Mrs. Crosbie,
quietly.</p>

<p>“I think so. But listen to me, Aunt Constance. I
have not crossed Stuart, I have not refused his request,
for I feared, in his weak state, to vex him; but he has
left everything in my hands, and I will——” She
stopped, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Mrs. Crosbie, almost sharply.</p>

<p>“Save him from this if I can.”</p>

<p>The words were uttered very quietly, and Mrs. Crosbie
drew a quick breath of relief.</p>

<p>“Vane,” she said, “forgive me; I was wrong to doubt
you, even for a moment.”</p>

<p>“I know what it is,” Vane went on, hurriedly—“a
glamour, a romance. Stuart has been here alone—he
has been bewitched. But I know, too, what a bitter
awakening it would be when the glamour was gone, the
veil of poetry and romance torn down; and, for his sake,
I will do it. Aunt Constance, do not think me bold—do
not think me unwomanly. I cannot help myself; I would
do anything for Stuart—for—for I—love him!”</p>

<p>Vane sank back and buried her face in her hands.
Mrs. Crosbie put her arms around her niece and drew
her to her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Unwomanly, Vane?” she said, gently. “I honor you.
This is as it should be.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you will keep my secret, Aunt Constance? He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
must not know—I would not let him know for untold
gold. If we succeeded in satisfying this girl’s ambition
or avarice—money generally heals such wounds as hers—we
must remember he will be troubled perhaps for a
time. I would not let him think my heart hungered for
him; my pride would suffer—it would kill me.”</p>

<p>“He shall not know, I promise,” Mrs. Crosbie responded,
stroking Vane’s soft hair. “But what shall we
do—how break this off? It has taken me at a disadvantage;
the very thought seems so monstrous, I cannot
yet believe it.”</p>

<p>“I want you to humor Stuart,” Vane said. “Let him
think that you may consent eventually; be proud and
cold, but not unkind. The blow must come from her.”</p>

<p>“How?” inquired Mrs. Crosbie, for once roused from
her calm demeanor.</p>

<p>“She must be convinced of the uselessness of her
scheme. I am going to her now, sent as Stuart’s messenger.
I think I shall pave the way, at any rate.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie clasped her niece’s hand for an instant,
and then turned aside.</p>

<p>“It is very bitter to me, Vane, to have to stoop to
deceit; but it is a deep wound to my pride, that Stuart,
my son, should so far forget his dignity as to think of
such a girl for his wife. You are prompted by the best
and noblest feelings, Vane; but I cannot bring myself to
submit to this degradation even for a minute. Stuart
must know the truth—must know how I judge him in
this.”</p>

<p>Vane rose hurriedly from her seat.</p>

<p>“I know you are right, Aunt Constance,” she responded,
quietly, though she was inwardly disturbed by
Mrs. Crosbie’s words; “but consider. Stuart is impulsive,
as strong-willed as yourself; if you cross him in
this, who knows but that he may do something rash—perhaps
marry the girl without delay, and be separated
from you forever? Is it not wiser to act cautiously, to
be careful and politic? I do not advocate too much
warmth on your part; meet Stuart coldly, but at the same
time throw no obstacle in the way. Believe me, dear
Auntie, you will be relieved of all anxiety if you do this.”</p>

<p>“But what do you propose?” asked Mrs. Crosbie, resuming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
her seat, and Vane saw that her advice had
taken root.</p>

<p>“We must let the separation come from her,” she answered,
quickly. “It will not do to send the girl away—that
would be but a stimulus to Stuart’s determination.
No; he must be disillusioned; and that will not be a
difficult matter, I should imagine.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie was silent for a few moments; she was
irritated and displeased more than Stuart imagined she
would be at the news of his attachment. To her it
seemed incredible that a Crosbie should stoop to humiliate
himself in this way. Vane’s words fell with good
effect upon her ears. Had her niece not been at hand
to smooth matters with gentle tact, she would not have
been able to restrain her anger. Something of the wisdom
of the girl’s advice came home to her as she mused.
She saw that Vane was urged by jealousy and pride to
break off this terrible connection, but she was quite
wrong in her conclusions as to the source of that jealousy.
She judged it to be solely the outcome of love for
her son, and the thought came as soothing balm at such
a moment. Once let them dispatch that girl, and the
marriage she had planned would take place.</p>

<p>Vane watched her aunt intently.</p>

<p>“You will consent?” she said, softly, breaking the
silence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mrs. Crosbie answered, abruptly.</p>

<p>Vane made no immediate reply, but her heart thrilled
with satisfaction. Now she must conjure up all her
power to defeat Margery Daw. Plan after plan followed
each other through her mind, but she could arrive at none
better than trampling on this village rival’s dignity and
wounding her pride with darts, the sting of which would
linger longest. Before she began the fray, however, she
must see Stuart, breathe in his ear that she had succeeded
with his mother, and thus allay any suspicion he might
entertain in the future that it was through her instrumentality
that his love-dream had been broken.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Crosbie, again, “I will act as you suggest.
I see plainly the wisdom of such a course. Were
I to display the anger I feel, the consequences might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
worse than the present state of things. At all hazards
we must separate him from this girl!”</p>

<p>Vane bent, and kissed her aunt.</p>

<p>“I am glad you see the matter as I do. Aunt Constance,
I feel I am right. Stuart must be saved from
this; and, if we work well, we shall do it. Now I must
start for the village. Remember, you will not let your
anger be seen.”</p>

<p>“It will be difficult, perhaps,” returned Mrs. Crosbie;
“but there is too much at stake, and I will control myself.”</p>

<p>Vane moved away slowly, leaving the mother plunged
in bitter thought, and mounted the stairs to her room.
She put on her pretty hat, smiling triumphantly at her
own image in the mirror, and, drawing on her gloves,
passed along the corridor till she reached Stuart’s door.</p>

<p>She knocked softly, and whispered to the servant:</p>

<p>“Is your master awake?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss.”</p>

<p>“Ask him to come to the door for one minute, if he
can.”</p>

<p>Vane fastened the last button of her glove, and then
stood waiting, a picture of grace and beauty, as Stuart
moved slowly into the doorway.</p>

<p>“I am going now,” she said, gently; “but, before I
start, I wanted to let you know that I have succeeded
with Aunt Constance. She——”</p>

<p>“She agrees?” interrupted Stuart, resting against the
door for support.</p>

<p>“Yes; but,” continued Vane, “you must not be surprised
if she is cold and hard. Of course, she was totally
unprepared for my news. I expect she will come
and see you directly. Now, will you trust me again,
Stuart?”</p>

<p>“Trust!” he echoed, putting out his hand. “I have
no words to thank you with, Vane. Margery and I owe
all our happiness to you.”</p>

<p>“I thought I would tell you; and now I must go,” Miss
Charteris said, hurriedly. “You look pale, Stuart.”</p>

<p>“My head aches confoundedly! I beg your pardon,
Vane, but I am not used to pain, and I grow impatient.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Tell Margery—— But I leave it all to you. Thank you
again and again.”</p>

<p>Vane descended the stairs rapidly, and she felt as she
seated herself in the smart pony-carriage that she had
fought half her battle, and that, with a little care and
discrimination, the victory would be easily and gracefully
won.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>


<p>Along the hot road, and through the village, where
her strange, dazed look awoke wonder in the women’s
minds, and set their tongues wagging in pity, toiled Margery.
She was filled with but one thought, one terrible
thought, which chilled her heart and roused her pride.
Stuart Crosbie had deceived her; he had deliberately
sought her, and—a blush dyed her cheeks at the remembrance—won
her love, her pure, innocent love, by false
vows, which were laughed to scorn, perchance, with his
cousin when he had left her. She did not doubt the
truth of the words she had just heard; they had been
spoken so naturally, the outcome of the speaker’s knowledge.
Had he not seen the lovers together? Was he not
in the house, with every opportunity of judging? Now
all was explained. Stuart had made his accident a pretext
for leaving her in her sorrow without a word or
sign. Her youth, her joy, her light of life was gone,
and henceforth she was alone in the world. Her heart
raised a cry against this man. Why had he sought her?
Why had he ruthlessly broken the charm of childhood,
and given her the sorrows of a woman? Why not have
left her in her innocence, content in her humble life?</p>

<p>During the past three months Margery had lived in an
atmosphere of indescribable happiness. She did not stop
to reason with herself as to whether Stuart Crosbie’s
comings and goings had not an unspeakable interest for
her. She had welcomed him as her friend, the dearest,
in truth, she possessed, until the day in Weald Wood, and
then what joy filled her being! Stuart loved her. The
truth was revealed to her; the key to her contentment—her
joyous spirits never saddened save when by the sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
woman’s couch—was grasped. And now all was at an
end. An indescribable pain pierced her heart; she never
realized till now how deeply her affections were centered
in him. Her shamed modesty resented the wound he had
inflicted. She recalled the words he had spoken, the
looks she had given, the kisses he had stolen from her
lips, and at each thought she grew fainter and pressed
her small hands against her heart to stay its throbbings.
She could think of nothing but the two figures standing
in Weald Wood, with the sunshine overhead; and the picture
brought a flush of shame to her face, a weight of
unspeakable grief to her heart.</p>

<p>She reached the cottage gate at last, and advanced
wearily to the door. The reality of Mrs. Morris’ death
came to her then in all its bitter force. In all the days
of her childhood, when trouble had overtaken her, she
had sought the gentle woman whose couch now stood
blank and empty, and had found solace in her soothing
love. Now she had none to whom she could turn, none
to bring her peace.</p>

<p>She threw off her hat, and, suddenly flinging herself
upon the couch, gave way to a flood of passionate tears.
A thousand thoughts coursed through her mind. Was
this the cross of her life? Was all that was beautiful
and happy gone forever from her? Was her lot henceforth
to be but sorrow and tears? Her spirit recoiled
from the vision of grief. Some lines she had read a
week before rose to her lips with an agony of despair:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“O God, I am so young, so young!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I am not used to tears at night</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Instead of slumber, nor to pray’r</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With sobbing lips and hands outwrung;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and, uttering a bitter cry, Margery buried her face in
her hands till the paroxysm was passed.</p>

<p>Fatigue and sorrow had told upon her, and she rose
from her knees looking, with her white, tear-stained face,
the ghost of the lovely girl of a week before. Her tears
had relieved her, the dull pain at her heart was gone;
but the passion of her grief had weakened her, and for
many minutes she lay back in a chair, the faint breeze
stirring the curls on her forehead.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of footsteps aroused her, and, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
up, she saw Reuben Morris enter the garden, accompanied
by a young man, who, despite his handsome face,
was certainly of a plebeian stamp. The two men were
talking earnestly; and Margery noticed with a pang the
stoop in the sturdy shoulders, the worn face of the bereaved
man. She had always loved him, though the link
that bound her to the dead woman was wanting in her
affection for him; and she forgot her own sorrow for the
moment in thinking of his.</p>

<p>She was leaning back in the shadow, and neither perceived
her; but her ears caught her own name; and, too
weary to move, she remained in her seat.</p>

<p>“Then you have not spoken to Margery yet?” she
heard the young man question.</p>

<p>“No; but I shall do it afore nighttime. I cannot bear
to think of quitting her, poor lamb! But there’s many
here as’ll be good to her, and I cannot stay in the place;
it would kill me.”</p>

<p>“You will be a loss, Morris,” returned the stranger.
“Have you sent word to Sir Hubert’s steward about
going?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just come from him. He spoke very kindly, and
tried to persuade me to stay on; but my mind is fixed,
and I was firm. Sir Hubert and my lady are not coming
home, after all, he tells me, for which I am sorry, as
Margery would——”</p>

<p>Margery rose and moved into the doorway, holding out
her hand to the speaker.</p>

<p>“I have heard what you have been saying, Dad Reuben,”
calling him by the name she had given him when
she was a child.</p>

<p>Reuben Morris drew her toward him.</p>

<p>“My poor lass!” he said, gently. “How worn and
tired you look! I meant to ha’ spoken to you to-night,
Margery.”</p>

<p>“Tell me now,” she urged, giving her hand to the
young man.</p>

<p>“I am going away, Margery,” Reuben replied. “I cannot
stay here. The sight of all she loved would kill me;
so I am just going to leave it all; and I start for Australia
at the end of the week. I have been up to Farmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Bright’s, and Mr. Robert has walked back with me to talk
it all over.”</p>

<p>“Australia!” repeated Margery, drawing closer to him.
“So soon!”</p>

<p>“Yes, lass; I must go. I have had an offer through
Farmer Bright to go up country to a man who wants a
stock-driver. It isn’t money that takes me, Margery. I
must quit Hurstley, or I shall go mad. But we must
think of you, lass?”</p>

<p>“I shall be all right,” Margery said, quietly. “I have
many friends; Sir Hubert’s steward will find me another
home till Lady Coningham comes back, and——”</p>

<p>“Yes; my mother has sent me here with a message to
you, Margery,” Robert Bright said, quickly. “She wants
you to come to her for a month or so.”</p>

<p>“She is very kind.”</p>

<p>“Wilt thou go, lass?” asked Reuben, gently.</p>

<p>Margery drew a quick breath.</p>

<p>“I cannot answer now,” she said; “to-morrow I will
tell you, Mr. Robert.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is no hurry,” Robert returned, heartily.
“Mother will welcome you gladly whenever you come.”</p>

<p>“Wait till to-morrow, and she’ll be with you,” Reuben
said, in the young man’s ear, as Margery turned indoors
again; then he added, in a louder tone: “I must go up to
the Weald for an hour, to see the men. Get thee some
rest, lass.”</p>

<p>“I will stay here, if Margery will let me,” Robert
Bright said, putting one foot on the doorstep, and glancing
into the room.</p>

<p>Reuben had moved away down the path, and the sight
of the girl’s pale, drawn face, and listless, drooping figure,
stirred the heart of the young farmer. For weeks
past he had grown to watch for this girl. Her rare
beauty and daintiness were as something heavenly in his
everyday life.</p>

<p>“You must not fret, Margery,” he said, as kindly as he
could; sympathy, always difficult to him, was almost impossible
now. “You are looking very pale and ill.”</p>

<p>The girl raised her hands, and pressed them over her
hot eyes; then she rose with a faint smile, and drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
nearer to the door, leaning back against it with a weary
little sigh.</p>

<p>“I am very tired,” she said, wistfully, “and the heat
tries me.”</p>

<p>“Come to my mother, and she will nurse you; you do
not know what a clever doctor she is. Come! Let me
take you away with me—I will borrow a cart from some
one in the village. Do come, Margery!”</p>

<p>Margery shook her head.</p>

<p>“I cannot go,” she answered, slowly. “Do not think
me unkind; I cannot go.”</p>

<p>His face fell, and there was silence between them for a
few minutes. Her heavily-fringed lids drooped over her
eyes, and so he gazed, while the love raging within his
heart urged him to take this frail, sad being from sorrow
to happiness. Suddenly it grew too much for him, and,
putting out his hands, he grasped hers tenderly.</p>

<p>“Margery,” he said—“my darling!”</p>

<p>Margery tremblingly withdrew her hands, and her eyes
met his glowing ones, with horror and distress in their
depths. She had never dreamed of this. She had liked
Robert, thinking him a cheery, kind-hearted man; but
love—love from him, when every pulse in her beat only
for Stuart! It was a horror—a sacrilege!</p>

<p>Robert Bright saw her slight shudder, and he tried once
more to grasp her hands.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Margery,” he said, hurriedly. “I would
not have spoken so soon, but something within me forced
me to do so. I could not bear to see you looking so pale
and ill. You want comfort now, and so I spoke. Margery,
I love you! My darling, don’t be frightened. Perhaps
I am rough; but I love truly—you cannot know how
truly, Margery!”</p>

<p>But she had drawn back, and, with her face buried in
her hands, had sunk into her chair again. As she felt his
touch on her shoulder, her hands dropped, but her head
was still lowered.</p>

<p>“You must not say such words,” she said, faintly.
“Dear Mr. Robert, forgive me, but—but I cannot hear
them. I——”</p>

<p>“I am a brute to tease you,” he broke in, quickly; “but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
Margery, I am not sane, now! I love you so dearly;
give me one kind word.”</p>

<p>“I cannot, I cannot!” she cried. “You must not hope.
Mr. Robert, I——”</p>

<p>“Not hope!” he repeated, blankly. “Not hope! Do
you mean that, Margery?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, putting one hand to her heart to
check its tumultuous throbbings. “Yes; I mean it. I
like you—you are so good; but love——”</p>

<p>The sadness of her accents touched him.</p>

<p>“Then forget it all,” he said, huskily. “Love does not
kill. I shall get over it. And yet——” He hesitated,
looked once more at her drooping figure, and then went
on, hurriedly: “Don’t let this stop you from going to my
mother, if you care to do so. I have to run up to London
to-night. We should not meet.”</p>

<p>Margery rose and held out her hands to him. In an
instant he had them pressed to his breast, his eyes fixed
on her face; but there was no indication of what he
sought in her pallid cheeks and trembling lips. He
loosened his grasp.</p>

<p>“Then,” he said, slowly, “there is no hope, Margery?”</p>

<p>“None,” she murmured, faintly.</p>

<p>Robert Bright pressed his lips to her hands, and the
next minute she heard his step grow fainter and fainter
along the path, and then the click of the gate told that he
was gone.</p>

<p>Margery sat on, dazed, almost stupefied. Then gradually
memory came back to her, bringing, in all its bitterness,
the old pain of the morning, with a fresh pang of
sorrow for the man who had just left her. She felt as
though she had been cruel to him. He had been so
earnest, so eager, and yet there was no hope. No hope!
Her heart echoed the dismal words. Life, that had been
so bright and beautiful, was now dark and drear as
winter gloom. She sat on, heedless of time’s flight,
vaguely watching the sun touch the trees with its afternoon
gold, and sadly musing on the dark, mysterious
future that stretched before her. At last she woke from
her sad thoughts. The click of the gate had caught her
ear, and she realized that the afternoon was nearly gone.</p>

<p>“It is Dad Reuben!” she murmured, and, rising, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
dragged herself from the chair, and stood, looking pale
and ill, as a shadow fell over the doorway.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>


<p>“You are Margery Daw?”</p>

<p>A cold voice fell on Margery’s ear. She turned, and
her eyes rested on Vane Charteris, looking inexpressibly
lovely and graceful in her white toilet. She looked
steadily at Margery, noting with secret pleasure her
worn, tear-stained face and dusty, disheveled appearance.</p>

<p>“I retract my first opinion,” she said to herself; “the
girl is absolutely plain.”</p>

<p>Some vague instinct called Margery’s pride to arms.
This woman hated her, she felt, though their eyes had
met but once before. She drew herself up, and, resting
one hand on her chair, faced her unwelcome guest. What
had brought her to the cottage? Margery felt her limbs
trembling; but her face showed no sign of the agony in
her heart.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, steadily, “I am Margery Daw. Do
you wish——”</p>

<p>“First, let me express my sympathy for you in your
loss,” commenced Vane, modulating her voice to soft accents.
She saw at once that Margery regarded her as an
enemy; but she did not intend to allow that thought to
become rooted. She must clothe her darts with kindness,
and with her sweetest words thrust her dagger into this
girl’s heart. “None can know but those who have suffered
what your grief must be,” she finished, gently.</p>

<p>Margery’s head drooped. Had sorrow already destroyed
all her good impulses? She was prepared for
war, and she met with sympathy, almost tenderness!</p>

<p>“You are very good,” she faltered.</p>

<p>Vane advanced into the room and pulled forward a
chair.</p>

<p>“May I sit with you for a while?” she asked. “It is
not good for you to be alone like this.”</p>

<p>“I like it,” answered Margery, turning her lustrous
eyes upon her guest; and as Vane saw their beauty, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
brows contracted, and she realized that her first judgment
regarding this girl had been right, after all.</p>

<p>Her mood changed. When she had considered Margery
plain, a half-contemptuous thought had passed
through her mind to wound yet retain her sweetness.
Now, she felt she cared not how hard she struck to relieve
the jealousy and dislike that rankled in her bosom.</p>

<p>She leaned back languidly in her chair; and somehow
the thought struck Margery that she had never seen
the little room look so small and shabby before. The
delicate gleam of Vane’s white garments contrasted
strongly with her own dingy, dust-stained black dress;
the placid beauty of Miss Charteris’ face brought back
the thrill of pain to her heart. How different they were!
Who was she, to compete with such a woman? She
roused herself from her thoughts as she met Vane’s cold,
clear eyes watching her.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” she said, quickly, yet with unspeakable
grace. “You have had a long drive; may I
give you a cup of tea—or perhaps you would prefer some
milk?”</p>

<p>She moved toward an inner room; but Vane stopped
her.</p>

<p>“Neither, thank you,” she replied, coldly—she was
growing more and more annoyed every moment. She
was being treated with every courtesy, with all regard for
etiquette, as though her hostess were a duchess instead of
a common village girl! It was insupportable; she must
hasten to break down that calm exterior which irritated
her beyond measure. “Neither, thank you,” she repeated;
“I shall not stay long. It is, as you say, a tedious
drive; but my cousin, Stuart Crosbie, wished me to
see you.”</p>

<p>She bent her head to look at her flounce, but not before
she had seen the girl’s slight frame wince and her
cheeks grow paler.</p>

<p>“That shot went home!” she told herself.</p>

<p>Margery stood immovable, her hand still grasping the
chair. A few moments before, she had thought it impossible
to suffer greater mental pain than she had endured;
now she was experiencing pangs still greater, for her
wound was being probed. Weak, faint from want of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
food as she was, she determined to be brave, to stand firm
before this woman—her rival.</p>

<p>“I scarcely know how to begin,” continued Vane, with
well-assumed kindness and concern. “It’s a delicate subject;
yet I could not well refuse Stuart.” She hesitated
for an instant, then held out her well-gloved hand. “Miss
Daw,” she said, impulsively, “will you forgive me if anything
I may say in the course of our conversation should
vex you? I would not, indeed, willingly cause you any
pain.”</p>

<p>Margery’s eyes were fixed on the golden-tinted trees
beyond the garden; she did not notice the outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>“Why should you cause me pain?” she asked, in reply.
“There is nothing in common between you and
me.”</p>

<p>Vane let her hand drop to her side; her face flushed.
Could she never shake this girl’s control?</p>

<p>“I am glad you judge me rightly,” she responded, “for
I am here and have been much distressed by my errand.
Stuart has asked me, Miss Daw, to express to you his
sincere sympathy in the loss you have sustained by the
death of Mrs. Morris. He begs me to tell you that he
trusts you will apply at the castle now that you are left
without a guardian. He has enlisted his mother’s goodwill
on your behalf, and he sends you this sum to assist
toward anything you may require.”</p>

<p>She held out a small packet as she finished, and had
the satisfaction of seeing Margery’s lips twitch as with
sudden pain, and her whole frame shake with passion beneath
the insult.</p>

<p>“It was his intention to write to you as far back as
last Thursday,” went on Vane; “but he had the misfortune
to break his right arm, and writing was impossible;
therefore, as he thought you would require some explanation
from him, he asked me to come.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” fell from Margery’s lips, in cold, strained
tones.</p>

<p>“Then I may leave this?” Vane said, interrogatively,
rising and placing the packet on the table. “And you
will promise to apply at the castle with respect to anything
concerning your future? I believe, but I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
sure, that Mrs. Crosbie has already written to some lady
about a situation for you as maid.”</p>

<p>Margery made no answer, and Miss Charteris waited a
few moments, and then moved to the door, feeling
strangely uncomfortable, and by no means victorious.
She looked back as she stood at the door.</p>

<p>“You have no reply?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Crosbie’s explanation requires none,” Margery
answered, still in the same cold, even tones.</p>

<p>“Then I will wish you good-afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Stay!” cried Margery; and Vane turned toward her.
“You have forgotten your packet,” Margery added, pointing
to the table.</p>

<p>Vane took it up without a word. Then a thought
seemed to strike her, and she turned the money round
and round in her hand hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will write to Stuart or to his mother?”</p>

<p>Margery’s eyes met Vane’s in an unflinching gaze.</p>

<p>“Write!” she repeated, with unutterable scorn and
pride in the word. “There is, indeed, little in common
between us. Such a question deserves no answer.”</p>

<p>Vane’s brows contracted. She turned and walked
quickly to the carriage, and, entering it, drove swiftly
away. Her musings were not altogether pleasant during
the first mile or so of her return journey. She had succeeded,
and succeeded so well that she need never fear
Margery Daw again; yet her spirit was vexed even at
her victory, for, though she had forever separated Stuart
and this girl, she had not lowered her rival to the dust, as
she had intended.</p>

<p>This thought rankled for some time; then her mind
wandered to the more important matter of dealing with
Stuart. She had no settled plan; but, as he was still so
unwell, there would be a day or two yet in which to arrange
matters. For the present she must satisfy him
with loving messages, and explain that Margery was too
distressed by her grief to accompany her back to the castle.
She must see her aunt immediately, and get her to
use her influence in some way to have the girl sent from
the village. It would never do to risk a meeting between
Stuart and Margery, for, though she judged the girl to
be too honest to say much, if indeed her pride would allow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
her to notice him at all, there would be sufficient to
fire Stuart’s anger and determination to learn the truth;
and then——</p>

<p>Vane’s face flushed at the thought of the humiliation
she would undergo in such a case; and she registered a
vow that she would never permit it to happen. Margery
must go and at once.</p>

<p>Margery remained standing at the door as Vane walked
down the path. She did not move as, in a dim way, she
saw Miss Charteris settle herself in the dainty carriage,
nor did she stir as the ponies started briskly from the
gate. But, as the sound of their hoofs died away in the
distance, she awoke with a shuddering sigh to the grossness
of the insults that had been offered her. Suddenly
her strength failed, and, with a groan, she sunk back on
her chair, burying her face in her hands. The thought of
her loneliness had been bitter, her lover’s false vows had
rankled in her breast; but the weight of Vane’s humiliating
words crushed her. It was almost greater than she
could bear.</p>

<p>She tried to banish all tender recollection of Stuart
from her, to think of him only as the one man who had
darkened the glory of life for her, as the man who had
plucked the sweet blossom of her love only to trample it
under foot; but she could not succeed. Her mind would
go back to those happy walks, those brief moments of
gladness when they met, till it wandered to that day in
Weald Wood, when, with her hand clasped in his, she
had sworn to love him always, no matter what came between
them. Yes, she loved him—would love him to the
end; though he had deceived and injured her, though he
had treated her with such scant courtesy and degraded
her shamefully, her love was still the same.</p>

<p>She shook back her wealth of red-gold curls and rose
to her feet; she was growing calmer. She reflected that
she had yet to plan her future. She pushed the chair to
the doorway and sunk into it. The sun was sinking behind
the woods; the air was soft and balmy—its touch
seemed like a kiss upon her cheek. The musical note of
a bird twittered its “good-night” amid the leaves, the
babble of the distant brook, soothed her. She leaned
her weary head against the door, and began to think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>One idea stood out clearly—she must leave Hurstley.
She dared not even picture to herself a future in the village,
where her eyes would rest on Stuart smiling on that
cold, cruel woman—where she must sit down beneath a
repetition of insult that had already roused her spirit almost
to madness. No, there was no other course open to
her—she must go, and soon. Ah, if she could but rush
away at once, and let the veil of darkness cover her humiliation!
But whither and to whom could she go?
Reuben could not take her with him. Mrs. Bright would
welcome her for a while; but she could not meet Robert—poor
Robert!</p>

<p>Like a flash of light in darkness came the remembrance
of Miss Lawson, and the letter from her sister. Would
it be too late? It was not a week ago. This must be
her chance. She rose hurriedly, her limbs trembling,
and tied on her bonnet. She would go to Miss Lawson
at once; the place might still be vacant; she might start
perhaps in the morning! The thought lent her strength.
She forced herself to eat some food, though every nerve
in her body was quivering from excitement.</p>

<p>The simple viands, the glass of milk, seemed to put new
life into her; she left a message for Reuben at the next
cottage, and started in feverish haste for the rectory,
losing all thought of fatigue in the rush of eager desire
and hope that burned within her.</p>

<p>Miss Lawson was seated at her window, writing, when
her eyes fell on Margery’s figure coming rapidly up the
path. The governess noted the girl’s pale cheeks, her
worn look of pain, and her heart thrilled with sympathy.</p>

<p>“Well, child?” she said, as the girl came in.</p>

<p>“Miss Lawson——” began Margery, and then her
rapid walk told on her, and she half reeled to a chair.</p>

<p>The governess rose, untied the bonnet, and held a glass
of water to her lips. She saw at a glance that something
was wrong; but she asked no questions.</p>

<p>“You have walked too quickly, as usual, Margery,”
was all she observed, as she turned away with the glass.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you,” murmured Margery; then, after
a brief pause, she added slowly, “You remember what
you said, Miss Lawson, that evening we parted—you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
would help me? I have come to claim that promise. I
want——”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you want.”</p>

<p>“I want what I refused that night—to leave Hurstley—go
away altogether. Is it too late—oh, Miss Lawson, is
it too late to go to that poor young lady?”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson looked at her keenly.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied; “it is not too late. Strangely
enough, I have heard from my sister again, urging me to
persuade you. This letter I am writing is to her. I
can tear it up.”</p>

<p>Margery felt the first thrill of pleasure she had experienced
during the long, dreary day.</p>

<p>“And soon—may I go soon?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The sooner the better—in fact, to-morrow, if you can
be ready.”</p>

<p>“I could be ready to-night,” Margery answered, with a
weary sigh, pushing aside her curls.</p>

<p>“Then I will telegraph to my sister in the morning,
when you start. I will go with you to Chesterham and
see you into the train, and I think you had better get
yourself one or two things when there; you can repay me
out of your first quarter’s salary.”</p>

<p>Margery bent her lips to Miss Lawson’s hand.</p>

<p>“I can never thank you sufficiently,” she whispered;
“you are too good to me.”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson pulled away her hand with a jerk; but
her face bore no trace of anger.</p>

<p>“Have you spoken to Reuben?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No; but I will at once. He leaves Hurstley himself
at the end of the week.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am heartily glad, child, you have decided on
this. I think you will be happy.”</p>

<p>“I shall be away from here, and that will be enough,”
was Margery’s muttered thought.</p>

<p>“I will speak to Mrs. Carr to-night. She will spare me
to-morrow, I know,” continued Miss Lawson. “You
must be ready about eight in the morning, Margery.
Your luggage will not be much; perhaps you can arrange
with Reuben to take it for you to the corner of the lane,
and I will meet you there with the village fly.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Margery again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>All was settled, and a feeling of peace stole into her
breast. She would disappear—leave behind her everything
that recalled her brief dream of bliss, her agony
of grief. Stuart would be troubled no more with the
sight of her sad face to dim his happiness. He had regarded
her as a poor village girl, without heart, mind
or pride—a toy with which to while away the long, dull
hours; and, as he had forgotten her—as she had gone
from his memory—she would creep away in deed and in
truth. She felt, as she sat in the twilight of the room
that had seen her so often in her young, fresh content,
that she would be satisfied if her name could be forgotten
by Hurstley forever, if, with her departure, the veil
of mystery that hung over her birth might envelop her
in its folds, and she might be lost.</p>

<p>Miss Lawson, turning from her writing-desk, saw the
plaintive look on the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“What is it, Margery?” she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>Margery broke from her thoughts.</p>

<p>“I was wishing,” she began, then hesitated, rose suddenly,
and went and stood beside her governess, putting
one little hand on the elder woman’s. “You are so kind,
so thoughtful,” she said, gently. “You ask me no questions,
do not examine me as to why I have come to-night.
I must leave Hurstley, and at once; there is a reason, but
I cannot tell you yet. Still you will believe and trust me,
will you not? Yes, yes, I know you will. I have only
you to help me now in the whole world, and you will not
fail me.”</p>

<p>“You wish me to do something more?”</p>

<p>“I want to be lost to Hurstley. I want no one but you
to know where I have gone. I want you to keep my
secret.”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson drew the girl into the fast-fading light,
and scrutinized her face earnestly, almost sternly. The
weary sadness in the beautiful eyes, the trembling lips,
the wistful expression, told their tale. Miss Lawson was
satisfied.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she promised, “I will do as you wish—your
secret shall be safe.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Immediately on her return to the castle, Vane Charteris
sought her aunt, and whispered to her the success
of her mission. Mrs. Crosbie willingly agreed to drive
over early the next morning, and see what could be done
with respect to dispatching Margery from the village;
and Vane went up to her room, both satisfied and triumphant.
Stuart’s eagerness was fed by fictitious tender
messages from Margery, which Vane uttered glibly and
without the slightest effort; and so the first part of her
plot proved most successful. She learned from her aunt
that the mother and son had met, and that Mrs. Crosbie
had carried out her part to the letter, thereby causing
Stuart no little surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p>The news of Margery’s disappearance came like a thunderclap
to Vane. She had never contemplated this <i>dénouement</i>,
and was a little puzzled how next to act, until
Mrs. Crosbie, in recounting the occurrences of her morning’s
drive, incidentally mentioned that she had met Mrs.
Bright, who was in great distress about her son.</p>

<p>“What has happened to him, Aunt Constance?” asked
Vane, with assumed indifference.</p>

<p>“I thought I said that he was in love with this girl—wished
to marry her, in fact—and is so troubled at her
refusal that he has determined to leave England.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated Vane, looking up suddenly, her cold,
blue eyes shining like stars. “Reuben Morris has gone
to Australia, you say?”</p>

<p>“He starts at the end of the week; he left Hurstley
for London this morning.”</p>

<p>“And the girl is with him?” next queried Miss Charteris.</p>

<p>“She must be. The cottage is shut up, the key has
been sent to the Weald, and the neighbors tell me they
saw both the man and the girl leave early this morning.”</p>

<p>“Could Mrs. Bright give you no clew as to where her
son has gone, or intends to go?”</p>

<p>“None. She gave me his note to read, in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
merely says he shall leave England for a while. This
girl has bewitched him. A marriage with him would
have been the best she could expect—indeed, much too
good for her,” remarked Mrs. Crosbie, coldly. “What
do you propose to do now, Vane?” she added, rising.</p>

<p>“Nothing. I have finished. Aunt Constance, the
game is ours. Do you not see that this young man has
gone to Australia with them?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie removed her driving-gloves slowly.</p>

<p>“I scarcely think that Vane,” she replied, “for Margery
Daw has refused to become his wife. His mother
is highly incensed and greatly troubled, poor creature,
about it. No, I cannot think that, Vane.”</p>

<p>“It will prove to be the truth, nevertheless,” Miss
Charteris said, quietly; adding, “and, as such, it is welcome
as a full and complete solution to a difficult and
disagreeable question. Poor Stuart—I am sorry for
him!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie glanced at her niece, leaning languidly
against the open window, almost frail-looking in her
delicate white gown, and could scarcely reconcile the
strong, cold, relentless spirit with so lovely an exterior.
For an instant a feeling of disgust at this girl’s calm
trickery and deceit, and at her own share in the matter,
passed over her. Then her pride came to the rescue, and
she consoled herself with the thought that Stuart had
been saved from dishonor and trouble, and that Vane
had done well. She bent and kissed her niece’s delicate
cheek.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right,” she said, thoughtfully. “The
problem is solved, and you have done it. I cannot thank
you enough, Vane.”</p>

<p>“Do not thank me at all,” the girl whispered. “You
know why I did it—it was my love for Stuart that
prompted me. Some day he will thank me, perhaps. But
for the present I fear he will suffer.”</p>

<p>“With you near, Vane, that will not last,” and, with an
affectionate glance, Mrs. Crosbie left the room.</p>

<p>The next day came, and Stuart still lived in his blissful
dreams. Then, with a rough hand, they were ruthlessly
shattered. Vane was reading in the colonnade that afternoon,
when she saw hurried steps approaching, and, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
looking up, saw Stuart, his face as white as his tennis
coat, beside her.</p>

<p>“What is it, Stuart?” she asked, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Vane, something has happened so strange, and yet so
absurd, that, were I not so confoundedly weak, I should
laugh at it. My man Andrews has just told me that
Morris has left Hurstley—left early yesterday morning—for
Australia, and Margery has gone with him. He declares
that it is true.”</p>

<p>“True!” repeated Vane. “It is too absurd to credit for
one instant. Stuart, how can you believe it?”</p>

<p>“The man is so positive,” Stuart went on, with a sigh,
resting his left hand on a chair for support, “that it quite
staggered me. Of course, there is some mistake; but it
haunts me, nevertheless. Vane, will you drive me to the
village?” he asked, abruptly. “I must make inquiries.”</p>

<p>“Willingly;” and Vane at once put down her book.</p>

<p>“How good you are!” exclaimed Stuart, trying to force
a smile. “You are indeed a friend.”</p>

<p>With a little laugh Vane put her hand on his lips and
flitted away, while Stuart called to a gardener and ordered
the pony carriage to be brought round.</p>

<p>Vane was down again almost immediately, her face
nearly as pale as her cousin’s. It was but a few minutes
before the carriage appeared, yet to Stuart they seemed
hours. He tried to laugh at the absurdity of the report,
yet a presentiment of trouble possessed him.</p>

<p>“It cannot be, it cannot be!” Vane heard him mutter
again and again; and then he approached her.</p>

<p>“Tell me once more the messages she sent,” he said,
hurriedly; and Vane breathed the tender falsehoods in his
ear, touching his agitated, troubled spirit with their healing
balm.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Gerant passed through the hall just as they
were starting.</p>

<p>“Whither away, wounded knight?” he asked, lightly.</p>

<p>“To the village. I shall be back soon, Douglas.”
Then, turning to his cousin, he said, “Drive fast, Vane.”</p>

<p>With a puzzled brow Sir Douglas watched them disappear—he
could not understand Stuart’s apparent attachment
to this selfish, worldly girl—then, with a sigh,
turned wearily indoors. The next day was that fixed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
his lawyer to come down from London, and he had much
to occupy his thoughts. He sought the squire’s room,
and, in a chat over bygone years, lost for a while his
anxious, restless expression.</p>

<p>Stuart sat silent beside his cousin as they bowled along
the lane to the village; and Vane glanced now and again
at his pale, pained face, wondering, when he knew the
truth, what his opinion would be of her.</p>

<p>The village reached, he broke the silence by asking
Vane to drive straight to the little cottage by the Weald;
and, without a word, she complied. She drew up the
ponies on the brow of the hill; and Stuart, heedless of his
aching arm and weakness, alighted, and walked down to
the gate he knew so well. It was just such an afternoon
as that on which he had parted from Margery, and the
memory of her beauty and sweetness lent strength to his
faltering steps and fed the eagerness and desire in his
heart. He pushed open the gate and entered. The window-blinds
were drawn; the door—pushed with his one
able hand—defied every effort. He grew faint and cold,
and leaned against the doorpost for a moment, while the
roses, nodding in the breeze, seemed to whisper to him a
sense of his loss in all its bitterness.</p>

<p>Margery was gone! But why—and whither? He
turned and walked down the garden, his head drooping
dejectedly on his breast. Margery gone! What could it
mean? Why had she left him, without a word or sign, in
the very moment of their joy and happiness? The truth
did not come to him even then. There must be some
mistake, he tried to convince himself. A hundred different
answers to the strange question came to him. He
closed the gate behind him and turned away. There was
a man standing at the gate of the next cottage, and at
first Stuart determined to pass him; but a sudden impulse
seized him, and he stopped and spoke with forced lightness.</p>

<p>“Ah, Carter—lovely weather for the crops! Is this
true that I hear about Morris?”</p>

<p>“Good-arternoon, squire. Hope I see you better. It
were a stiffish fall as you had. Morris, sir? What?
That he’s gone to Australia? Ay, sir—that’s true
enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>Stuart’s left hand grasped the gate.</p>

<p>“Rather sudden, isn’t it?” he questioned, trying to
clear his voice.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it were rather; but, you see, the death of his
missus fair knocked him over, and he made up his mind
in a minute.”</p>

<p>“And he has gone alone?” asked Stuart, every nerve in
his body quivering.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir! He’s took Margery with him; and right
sorry are we to part with her, I can tell you. She were
just a sweet lass. Have you heard that Sir Hubert and
my lady ain’t coming home, after all, sir? Perhaps that’s
why Margery went, ’cos she belongs like to her ladyship—don’t
she, sir?”</p>

<p>Stuart murmured a few vague words in reply, and then
passed on.</p>

<p>“Good-arternoon,” said Carter; and then, as he
watched the young man mount the hill, he muttered:
“That there fall ain’t done the young squire no good;
he looks the ghost of hisself.”</p>

<p>Vane sat silent as Stuart came toward her; even her
cold, calculating heart was touched at the sight of his
distress. He took his seat and sunk back against the
cushions, looking deathly pale and worn. Vane gathered
the reins together, and prepared to turn back to
the castle; but Stuart stopped her.</p>

<p>“Drive to Chesterham,” he said, in a quiet tone. “I
must find out if they went to London.”</p>

<p>Without a word she did as he wished, and in silence
they sped along the lanes to the town. Vane was by no
means comfortable during the drive, for she was beset
by disagreeable thoughts. What if the girl, after all,
had gone to London only to bid farewell to her adopted
father? What more likely? Would she not have taken
leave of the neighbors and villagers had she started for
so long a journey? What if, on their arrival at Chesterham,
they came face to face with her? Vane grew cold
and faint at the thought not only of the humiliation, but
of such a termination to all her scheming. She set her
teeth, and her face grew paler as she pictured his disgust
when he learned the truth. It was so hasty, so strange a
flight, that Vane, as she sat absorbed in deep thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
could not but feel the chances were very much against
her.</p>

<p>Stuart did not notice his cousin; he realized only that
Margery was gone, his sweet love vanished. The joy
of life for him was dead, and his heart was heavy with
its pain. Hope now and then revived, but the vague presentiment
that had hung over him since first he had
learned the news crushed it as it was born.</p>

<p>As they approached Chesterham, Vane began to tremble,
and the hands grasping the reins shook with fear.</p>

<p>“Draw up for a few minutes, Vane,” Stuart said;
“here is Bright—perhaps he can tell us something. Andrews
said it was through his instrumentality that Morris
had gone.”</p>

<p>Vane checked the ponies and leaned back, feeling quite
unnerved from the sudden reaction.</p>

<p>“Ah, Bright, you are the very man that I want to
see,” exclaimed Stuart, as the farmer rode up, “for you
can tell me better than any one what I want to know.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to oblige you, Mr. Stuart,” returned
Bright, turning an anxious face to the young man.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ve heard about my boy Robert?” he
added, full of his own troubles.</p>

<p>“No, I have not. Is anything the matter with him?”
asked Stuart, his sympathy at once enlisted.</p>

<p>“It’s nigh broke his mother’s heart, sir; but he’s gone
off to Australia with Reuben Morris all of a sudden,
without a word of warning.”</p>

<p>Vane felt a thrill of joy pass through her, and her
spirits at once began to revive.</p>

<p>“Australia? Why? But they can not have gone yet—they
must be in London. It is one thing to say you
will start on such a voyage, and another thing to do
it. It takes two or three days, Bright, you know, to
make the necessary arrangements.”</p>

<p>The farmer looked at the young squire’s flushed, eager
face with a little surprise and much gratitude.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. It’s like you, Mr. Stuart, always to
be kind; but it’s no use now, sir. Robert started last
night; by this time they’re out of the Channel. It’s a
hard thing to see one’s only son took from us, Mr.
Stuart, and all along of a bit of a girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“A girl!” echoed Stuart, shivering, he scarcely knew
why.</p>

<p>“Ay, sir—that lass of Morris’, that nameless thing!
She just bewitched him, has played the fool with him,
said him ‘No,’ when he’d have made her his wife, and
now has took him on again, for they’ve all gone out together.”</p>

<p>“Margery!” exclaimed Stuart, in a dull, startled way.
“She—they have gone together?”</p>

<p>“Ay, sir—she’ve took him from us all with her fooling,
and I make no doubt but they’ll be married afore they
reach the other side. The mother would have welcomed
her gladly to keep Robert at home; but she weren’t honest
enough to do that—she must needs give herself airs
like a fine lady, and drag my boy after her.”</p>

<p>Vane saw Stuart’s jaw set, his face flush, the veins on
his forehead swell. After a pause, he said, in a low tone:</p>

<p>“And you are sure of this, Bright?”</p>

<p>“I’m just back from London, sir. I’ve been down to
the docks, and there’s no mistake; they all remembered
the girl—her pretty face, they called it. Ah, it will be
weary work for us, sir, waiting till Robert comes back!
My wife’s most distraught.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Bright.” Stuart put out his hand, which
the farmer grasped. “This is indeed bad news! I am
sorry, very sorry for you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mr. Stuart.”</p>

<p>Bright loosened Stuart’s hand, and, with a respectful
salute to Vane, passed on, something like a tear twinkling
in his eye.</p>

<p>Vane looked straight ahead, pretending not to see the
quick, hurried way in which Stuart bent his head for a
moment. Victory was hers, she told herself—victory!
Suddenly Stuart looked up.</p>

<p>“Turn around, Vane, and drive home; it is all over
now—so much the better!”</p>

<p>The recklessness of his tone pleased her; it showed her
that anger rankled as well as pain, that mortification
filled his breast with despair. If this mood lasted, her
work would not be difficult.</p>

</div>


<p>“Margery! Margery!”</p>

<p>The light of the setting sun was gilding the branches
of the few trees standing in the center of the square garden.
A girl was sitting in a bay window in one of the
largest and gloomiest of the houses in the square, apparently
watching the sunset; but really the sunset had
no charm for her. She was so deep in thought that the
sweet tones coming from the further end of the room did
not reach her.</p>

<p>“Margery!”</p>

<p>The girl turned quickly, her musings disturbed by the
touch of plaintive wistfulness in the last word.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Lady Enid,” she said, hurriedly,
moving from the window.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to disturb your dreams, Margery,” observed
Lady Enid, gently, “but I should like to sit up for
a while, and no one can help me like you.”</p>

<p>She smiled affectionately as she spoke, her beautiful,
dark eyes resting with pleasure on the figure of her
young companion; she looked so dainty, so frail, yet so
lovely, lying back on her cushions, that it was hard to
imagine so fair a form was aught but perfect. It was
an angel’s face, pale and sweet, surrounded by short,
wavy locks of rich, dark-brown hair, and lighted by a
pair of luminous brown eyes.</p>

<p>Margery bent quickly and took away the silken coverlet
from the couch, then, putting her arm under the
slight figure, raised it easily into a sitting position;
thence, after a moment’s pause, she assisted the invalid
to a large, luxurious chair drawn close at hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Lady Enid, as she reclined against
the well-padded, upright back. “How good you are,
Margery! What should I do without you?”</p>

<p>Margery smiled, and, pushing up another chair, seated
herself near the speaker.</p>

<p>Two months had passed since she left Hurstley—two
long, peaceful months; and, though she could not say she
was happy, she was content. She seemed in those eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
weeks to have put all girlishness from her; her figure,
in the simple gray gown that fitted to perfection, was
already touched with the grace of a woman; her face, as
lovely as of yore, bore, nevertheless, the traces of thought
and the expression of a deep, all-searching mind. She
wore her red-gold tresses curled high on her small head,
and this gave her a dignified and maturer air.</p>

<p>“Do not talk of my goodness,” she answered, lightly.
“What are my little efforts, compared with all the kindness
you have shown me?”</p>

<p>“You cannot guess, Margery, how different my life has
been since you came to me. Now, don’t shake your head!
I can never say it often enough. Do you know, I had a
presentiment that we should become friends the very instant
Mrs. Fothergill mentioned your name? Margery
Daw! There is a sweetness about it, a touch of romance.
I was quite eager you should come, and I was so happy
when the letter arrived saying that you would. I am
afraid, dear,” Lady Enid added, with a sigh, “that sometimes
it is very lonely and dull for you here, with only a
poor sick girl for company.”</p>

<p>Margery slipped to her knees beside the slight form in
its cardinal-colored silk wrapper.</p>

<p>“Never say that again—never,” she said, “for I will
not listen.”</p>

<p>Lady Enid smiled; and Margery bent her lips to the
thin, white hand.</p>

<p>“Are you comfortable?” she asked, gently.</p>

<p>“Quite. Now stay here, Margery, and let us chat together.
When the lamps come, I will hear you sing; but
this is what I enjoy. I have been thinking to myself, as
I lay on my couch, what a delight it would be to find out
the truth about your poor young mother. How glad I
should be if we could discover a clew!”</p>

<p>“I have given up all hope,” Margery responded,
dreamily.</p>

<p>“Then it is wrong of you,” Lady Enid said, reprovingly,
while she stroked Margery’s soft curls caressingly.
“I do not mean to do so if you do. I have thought of all
sorts of plans; but the best of them all is to put the
whole affair into Nugent’s hands.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Lady Enid, your brother, Lord Court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
will have other and more important things to employ
him.”</p>

<p>“Nugent always does anything that gives me pleasure,
and this would be pleasure, indeed. You know, Margery,
I have written so much about you; and only in his
last letter he said he was so delighted to hear that I had
at last secured a real friend and companion.”</p>

<p>“He is very fond of you, I know,” Margery responded,
softly. She knew that on the theme of this beloved
brother Lady Enid would talk for hours, and she welcomed
any subject that interested the poor young patient,
being content herself to listen, for it banished more
painful thoughts.</p>

<p>“Nugent has loved me as a father, mother, brother,
all in one; we were left orphans so young; and, oh, Margery,
you could never fathom how dear he is to me!
When I was well and could run about I can remember
that my greatest treat was to have a holiday with Nugent.
Then, when my illness came, and I was crippled
for life, it was Nugent who brought all the happiness, all
the light into my existence. We were alone in the world,
and he treasured me as the greatest jewel till——” Lady
Enid paused. “Margery,” she went on, after a brief
silence, “I dare say you have often wondered why Nugent
does not come home, why he has left me here so
long alone?”</p>

<p>“I have, sometimes,” confessed Margery.</p>

<p>“And you have thought him unkind. Ah, I will not
have him judged wrongly! I will tell you why he wanders
abroad, leaves his old home and me, his little sister.
Yes, I will tell you.”</p>

<p>“If it pains you, do not speak of it,” broke in Margery,
seeing the pale face contract a little.</p>

<p>“It is dead and gone, and I need grieve no more. Nugent
and I never speak of the past, but it will do me good
to open my heart to you. When, as I have told you before,
the doctors said I should be a cripple for life, I
thought my brother’s heart would break. He grew almost
ill with trouble, and it was not until he saw that I
was resigned and content that he recovered. He was so
good to me then; no one was allowed to touch me but he;
he lifted me and carried me from my couch to the chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
or to the bed; he regulated his whole life and career by
me. But for my illness he would have found a prominent
place in the government, and doubtless have become
a great man in the political world; but he renounced all
his ambitions—everything for me. We were living then
in our dear old home, Court Manor, of all Nugent’s possessions
the one we most cherished. I should like to take
you there, Margery, to show you its quaint rooms and
corridors, let you lose yourself in the pleasance and
gardens. I was quite happy. Nugent never left me;
together we read, studied, sung; we wanted nothing
more than our two selves. Well, a day came that ended
it all.</p>

<p>“Court Manor is in Westshire, in one of the most picturesque
parts, and the village of Court consists of about
half-a-dozen cottages and a tiny church. There are several
country houses about, and the one nearest to us is
a large, rambling old place called the Gill. This has been
unoccupied, although richly furnished, for many years,
the owner living abroad; but suddenly one morning we
heard that the Gill was to have an occupant, and a few
days later that occupant arrived. We neither saw nor
heard anything of the new neighbor, till one afternoon,
as Nugent was reading to me, the lower gate clanged,
sounds were heard on the gravel path, and a moment
later a woman on horseback passed the window. She
asked to be admitted to me; but I begged Nugent to excuse
me, and he received her alone. I questioned him
closely when the visitor was gone; but he gave me little
information about her appearance, and only said, in
rather a constrained way, that she was a widow—a Mrs.
Yelverton—who had taken the Gill for the hunting season.</p>

<p>“I dismissed her from my mind, and life went on as
usual for a few days; then it seemed to me that Nugent
was out a great deal more than formerly. He was hurried,
almost ill at ease, during our readings; and, when
I asked him the reason, he at last confessed that Mrs.
Yelverton had organized regular hunting parties at her
house, and had begged him to join them. I submitted
gladly, for I had long thought the life was dull for him;
and so the days passed on slowly, and we drifted gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
apart. I saw Mrs. Yelverton only once, and then I
was almost dazzled by the brilliancy of her beauty. Her
coloring was so rich, so vivid, that others paled beside
her, and her eyes, of a most unprepossessing tawny
shade, filled me with vague alarm. Apparently, she did
not care for me, for she never repeated her visit; and I
was left in peace till the end came.</p>

<p>“I will not linger over the rest, Margery; you can
guess it. Nugent had grown to love her—he was bewitched
by her beauty; and he whispered to me one evening
that she had promised to become his wife. I tried to
murmur words of happiness; but my heart failed me,
and I could do nothing but look into his dear face with
eyes that would speak my distress. Nugent left me that
night, hurt at my coldness; but all thought of me was
banished in the golden glory of his brief love-dream.
Brief! It was but three months after his betrothal that
his dream was shattered.”</p>

<p>Lady Enid moved restlessly in her chair, and Margery,
noticing her agitation, pressed tenderly the hot hands
that were clasped together.</p>

<p>“Do not go on,” she whispered; “it pains you.”</p>

<p>“No, no! I like to tell you, dear,” replied Lady Enid
hurriedly. “Nugent was starting one morning to ride to
the Gill; he had come into my room to kiss and greet me,
and was eager to be gone, when the footman entered with
a note. Nugent broke the seal and read it hurriedly,
then, with a face like death, staggered to a chair. I
begged in piteous tones that he would speak to me, tell
me what had happened—for, alas! I could not move!—and
after a while he thrust the note into my hands. It
was from a man signing himself ‘Roe,’ stating that he
had heard his wife was about to commit bigamy with the
Earl of Court, under the assumed name of Mrs. Yelverton,
and he warned Nugent against her in words that
were more than forcible. I tried to speak to my brother;
but his looks checked the words on my lips, and he strode
out of the room, mounted his horse, and tore like a madman
to the Gill.</p>

<p>“You can picture the misery of that day, Margery. I
tossed and moaned alone—longing for, yet dreading Nugent’s
return. At last he came, and I heard the end—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
agony in his face and voice would have wounded you to
the quick, Margery. The woman was indeed Roe’s wife,
and, when Nugent reached the Gill, he found everything
in the wildest confusion. The man and wife had had an
interview, in which he informed her that Lord Court
knew the truth; and this so incensed her that she drew
out a revolver and fired at him. Fortunately, the bullet
missed him, and the woman, finding herself baffled, fled.
Roe told Nugent the story of his miserable life. His wife
had deserted him, destroyed his whole career. He described
her as a desperate character, and thoroughly
abandoned. His words were true; for, Margery, it was
discovered that she had gathered together all the treasures
of the Gill, and would have eloped that very night
with a man who had served her as groom during her
stay there.</p>

<p>“Nugent seemed turned to stone when all was over; it
almost killed me to see him wandering about listlessly, all
happiness crushed out of his life. Then I spoke to him
and tried to persuade him to go abroad, to leave Court
Manor for a time. At first he would not listen to me;
but, after a while, the idea seemed to please him, and he
went, leaving me alone and miserable, and I came here,
ostensibly to be under the London doctors. I have seen
him only for a few days together in the four years that
have passed since that time; but his letters of late have
been brighter, and I live in the hope that he will return
to me as he was before his life was clouded.”</p>

<p>“It is a sad story,” murmured Margery. She had
risen, and was leaning against the broad chimney-board.
Trickery and deceit—who knew better than she how bitter,
how terrible they were? Did not her heart beat in
warm sympathy for this man, with his wounded heart,
his life spoiled by false vows? The story brought back
the agony of by-gone days; it paled her face and made
her hands tremble.</p>

<p>Lady Enid saw the distress she had produced, but attributed
it to the girl’s sympathetic nature.</p>

<p>“Dear Margery,” she said, gently, “do not look so sad.
You have a tender heart, dear; I am sorry I told you.”</p>

<p>“I am glad,” Margery murmured, “for it binds us
closer together. What suffering there is in the world!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes it seems too great for us poor mortals; yet,
Margery, this world is not all; we have a source of peace,
a Comforter in our greatest trials. You know these
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“‘I know not what the future hath</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Of marvel or surprise,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Assured alone that life and death</div>
<div class="verse indent4">His mercy underlies.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“They are beautiful!” Margery answered. “But it
is hard sometimes to believe them.”</p>

<p>“I do not think I should have lived through my trouble
if I had not known the truth of them. You have health—while
I——” Lady Enid gave a little sigh.</p>

<p>“I am selfish—cruelly selfish!” cried Margery, roused
by the pathetic sound.</p>

<p>Lady Enid stretched out one small hand and drew
Margery to her.</p>

<p>“You have a sorrow of your own, too!” she said, tenderly.
“Ah, yes; I have seen—I know it! Kiss me, Margery!
Some day, dear, perhaps you will tell me what it
is, and, if I can, with all my heart I will help you.”</p>

<p>Margery knelt beside the chair for a few moments;
then she raised her head.</p>

<p>“Some day I will,” she answered, steadily; then she
rose.</p>

<p>When the footman appeared with the lamps, Margery
turned to the piano. She had a sweet, sympathetic voice;
but, though Miss Lawson had taught her music, Margery
had had no singing lessons until she came to London to
be companion to Lady Enid Walsh. Then, hearing her
one night, the young invalid had been charmed, and insisted
on Margery’s receiving lessons and studying under
one of the best masters in town. She made rapid progress,
for she loved all music well.</p>

<p>“What will you sing, Margery?” asked Lady Enid,
leaning back, watching her young companion’s graceful
form with loving eyes.</p>

<p>“Elaine’s song, the song of love and death. I have a
new setting; it is very sweet.”</p>

<p>She played a few bars; then her voice filled the room
with melody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“It is too sad!” cried Margery, with forced lightness;
the misery of her own lost love was almost choking her.</p>

<p>“It is very beautiful,” said some one standing in the
doorway.</p>

<p>Margery rose quickly, and her eyes rested on the figure
of a tall, well-built man, with a keen, dark face, a tawny-brown
mustache hiding the mouth, and eyes of such liquid
beauty that not even the long scar on the forehead could
mar them.</p>

<p>Lady Enid uttered a cry of delight.</p>

<p>“Nugent—my brother! Oh, thank Heaven! I am so
glad—so glad!”</p>

<p>Lord Court had left the door, and was bending over
the slight figure of his sister. Margery, with tears of
sympathy in her eyes, turned away, and was leaving the
room, when Lady Enid noticed her.</p>

<p>“Margery,” she called, softly, “you must not go;” then,
turning to her brother, she said, “Nugent, this is Margery
Daw, whom I have so often written to you about;
she is my dear friend.”</p>

<p>“I am heartily glad to welcome you,” said Lord Court,
extending a hand to Margery. “I seem to know you
already through my sister’s letters. Let me thank you in
both our names for your kind attention to her.”</p>

<p>“My small services merit no thanks,” Margery responded,
simply. “I would do all in my power for Lady
Enid, for I love her.”</p>

<p>She moved forward and kissed the lips Lady Enid upheld
to her; there was a flush of delight on the pale face
of the invalid, a glow of unalloyed happiness in the lovely
brown eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, Nugent, it is like a gleam of sunshine to see you
again! Where have you come from?”</p>

<p>“From Italy. I paused only one day in Paris. I was
eager to see you, my darling.” Lord Court drew up a
chair to his sister’s side, and took her hand in his. “You
are looking better, Enid,” he added.</p>

<p>“That is due to Margery then. I am so happy with
her.”</p>

<p>“Miss Daw is a most successful physician,” the earl
remarked, smilingly.</p>

<p>“I give place to a better,” Margery replied; then, with
a sweet smile, she left the room.</p>

<p>“Is she not sweet, Nugent?” cried Lady Enid.</p>

<p>“It is the most beautiful face I have ever seen,” the
earl involuntarily declared.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The day succeeding the Earl of Court’s arrival was
passed by Margery principally in her own room. She
felt that the brother and sister had much to speak of that
was of moment to themselves, and she shrank, with natural
delicacy, from intruding. She employed her morning
in writing a long letter to Miss Lawson and painting
some handscreens for Lady Enid.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun tempted her to go out, and she wandered
round the garden in the square, ignorant that a
pair of dark eyes were fixed admiringly on her slight,
graceful figure and on the wealth of red-gold hair gleaming
in the sunlight. It was a dreary plot of ground to
call a garden—the trees were begrimed with the smoke
of the city, the flower beds were faded and dull, the very
earth was hard and cold-looking—yet all its dreariness
was lost on Margery. She paced its paths nearly every
day; but she did not see her surroundings—her mind was
too full of thought. In her moments of solitude her
memory claimed her, though she was struggling hard to
forget—the pain of her lost love was too new yet. Again
and again she would go back to those two days standing
out clear and distinct from all other days—the day of
happiness unspeakable and the day when the sun had
shone on the hot, dusty lane, and she had heard the words
that drove that wonderful happiness from her tender
young heart forever. She was content, gratefully content,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
in her present life, for she had peace and affection;
but happy, she whispered to herself, she could never be
again.</p>

<p>Her letters to Miss Lawson were cheerful and chatty,
but the governess put them aside with a strange sensation
of pity. She felt that there was some great sorrow, a
sorrow which Margery must bear alone, that none could
alleviate. She was gratified at the success of her pupil,
and from her sister, Mrs. Fothergill, she heard of the
warm friendship that already existed between Lady Enid
Walsh and her companion. The girl’s heartfelt gratitude
pleased and touched Miss Lawson, and she was glad to
know that her judgment of the maid’s character had been
right; that Margery was all she had expected. Gratitude,
indeed, was the warmest feeling in Margery’s breast just
now; she could not thank her governess enough for assisting
her at a time when she most needed assistance.
To have stayed at Hurstley would have been worse than
death, she told herself. As she crept away in the freshness
of the morning, she took her farewell of all that had
been dearest and best to her, and, with a courage born
of despair, faced the unknown future unfalteringly. Reuben
Morris had accepted with little surprise the news of
her hasty departure; he knew that Miss Lawson loved
the girl in her quiet way, and would watch over her, and
her speed to be gone matched his own plans, for the vessel
started three days earlier than he had expected, and
there was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>Margery traveled up to the great city, silent and sorrowful,
her hand clasped in Reuben’s, with Miss Lawson
by her side. Not till she reached the docks, whither she
had pleaded to be allowed to accompany Reuben, did she
learn that Robert Bright, too, sailed away from the old
country in the same ship, and the news was the last drop
in her already overflowing cup of grief. She spoke a few
words to him, urging him to stay; but, when she learned
that her love was all that could keep him, she was silent;
it was impossible—it could never be. So the two men
went together, and Margery stood beside Miss Lawson,
the tears blinding her eyes as the huge vessel glided
away. Then, in silence, they retraced their steps, and
Margery was launched upon the world. Her secret was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
safe. Hurstley chattered of her as in Australia, with
Reuben Morris and her lover; but Miss Lawson’s lips
were closed; she kept her promise.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>


<p>Margery was walking slowly to and fro in the square
garden, buried in her thoughts, when a firm step coming
toward her made her raise her head, and she saw Lord
Court, looking almost handsome and undeniably soldierly
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>“I am sent after you, Miss Daw,” he said, raising his
hat with a smile that lit up his plain face. “Enid is pining
for you, and thinks you will be fatigued with so
much walking.”</p>

<p>Margery laughed a little silvery laugh that sounded
strange in her own ears—it was long since she had been
merry.</p>

<p>“Lady Enid does not know my capabilities,” she answered.
“I am a country girl, and walking comes naturally
to me; but I am quite ready to go to her.”</p>

<p>Lord Court turned and kept pace beside her.</p>

<p>“I can see walking is a pleasure to you,” he remarked,
easily. “I have been watching you, Miss Daw, and have
been struck by the very un-English nature of your carriage;
you bear yourself like an Andalusian. There is
something peculiarly ungraceful in the ordinary Englishwoman’s
walk.”</p>

<p>“I think high heels have a great deal to answer for,”
Margery responded, the color just faintly tinting her
cream-white cheeks. “I have been seriously alarmed at
the shoes I have seen since I came to town; it must be
almost like walking on stilts.”</p>

<p>“They are for show, not use,” said the earl, smiling.
“What a beautiful sky! It reminds me of the sunsets we
used to see at Court Manor. My sister, I dare say, has
spoken to you of our old home, Miss Daw?”</p>

<p>“Lady Enid is never tired of dwelling on its beauties;
she seems to love it so much.”</p>

<p>“I have not seen it now for years,” the earl said—and
Margery saw a shadow cross his face; “but its memory is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
very dear. In point of beauty and value it does not compare
with either Drake Park or Hohen Castle, both Court
possessions; to me, however, it is far more beautiful.”
He paused, then said, abruptly, “Miss Daw, do you think
it would make Enid happier if she returned to the manor
for a while?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Margery answered, simply; “I am sure of it.
She is so good, so sweet, that she never complains; but I
know she is pining for a glimpse of the country, and I
think she would grow stronger out of London—she has
been in town so long.”</p>

<p>“What a selfish brute I have been!” muttered the earl
to himself. “Poor child—poor Enid! Thank you, Miss
Daw,” he added, quickly. “I will speak to her at once,
and make arrangements to start whenever she likes. But
you—you do not object to leave London?”</p>

<p>“I?” questioned the girl. “No, Lord Court, I have
no objection; it matters little to me where I am.”</p>

<p>He cast a quick, earnest glance at her.</p>

<p>“You are young to say that.”</p>

<p>Margery flushed; she had spoken unreflectingly, and
she regretted the words as soon as they were uttered.</p>

<p>“And wrong,” she said, with forced lightness. “I
shall enjoy the change; and anything that makes Lady
Enid happy is a great pleasure to me.”</p>

<p>Lord Court was silent, but he read her assumed manner
rightly. He knew Margery’s history well; still, he
felt instinctively it was not her orphan state alone that
had caused such a remark.</p>

<p>Margery was unaware of his covert glances; she picked
two or three leaves from the trees as she passed and arranged
them in a cluster with an artistic touch.</p>

<p>“You are an artist, Miss Daw,” the earl observed, as
they approached the gates.</p>

<p>“I paint a little, but only flowers,” she returned.</p>

<p>“I used the brush a few years ago,” Lord Court said,
“but I do nothing now, and, with the exception of a few
Egyptian sketches, I have no drawings of my travels.”</p>

<p>He opened the gate as he spoke; then, suddenly meeting
the full gaze of her wondrous eyes, he said, almost
involuntarily:</p>

<p>“I think I could paint you, if you would allow me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“I would sit to you most willingly,” Margery returned,
smiling, “but only on the condition that you make a picture
of Lady Enid.”</p>

<p>“It is a bargain!” he cried, and Margery felt a thrill
of pleasure at his words.</p>

<p>By this promise she knew she would bring happiness
to the young sister—happiness because her beloved Nugent
would be near her.</p>

<p>“Let us go and tell her at once,” she said, turning her
lovely face, flushed with pleasure, to him. “Ah, you will
see my words were right last night! You will be a better
physician than I could ever hope to be.”</p>

<p>The earl made no reply, but followed her across to the
house. At the door of Lady Enid’s room Margery
paused.</p>

<p>“It will gladden her more coming from you,” she whispered,
and she hurried away.</p>

<p>Lord Court watched her disappear, then entered the
room.</p>

<p>“Have you found her, Nugent?” asked Lady Enid, fixing
her brown eyes upon him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, drawing a chair to her couch and
looking at her pale face and fragile form with a dull
pain at his heart. “We have been talking together, Enid,
and we have made two arrangements which we hope will
please you. The first is for us all to go down to Court
Manor as soon as ever you like. The second is for me to
paint your portrait and your friend’s—Margery Daw.
Does that please you, my darling?”</p>

<p>Lady Enid raised her hands to her eyes—her face was
hidden. She made no reply, and her brother leaned over
her and kissed her tenderly.</p>

<p>“My sweet Enid!” he murmured. “My poor little one.
How selfish I have been!”</p>

<p>Lady Enid let her hands drop.</p>

<p>“Selfish—you selfish, Nugent? How can you say so,
when by this very proposal you sacrifice your own
wishes? No, my dear brother; I cannot accept it.”</p>

<p>“But it is my wish, Enid. It will be like a glimpse of
peace to see the old place; and, back in her own nest, my
darling will grow stronger, please Heaven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>Lady Enid’s face had grown a shade paler, her lips
were trembling.</p>

<p>“Nugent,” she said, slowly, “I will go; but, first, will
you do something for me?”</p>

<p>“Anything on earth!”</p>

<p>“Then, dear, I wish you to visit Drake Park and Hohen
before we start for the manor. It is our duty, indeed,
Nugent. Think. You have not been near your property
for so long that the tenants do not even know you. Will
you do so?”</p>

<p>“But I thought you would like to go straight to the
manor,” the earl said, slowly.</p>

<p>“I would rather wait and go with you, dear, and then
we can commence the portraits without further delay. I
shall be so glad to have a picture of my sweet Margery.
Ah, here she is! What plots have you two conspirators
been hatching? Come, confess!”</p>

<p>“Do they not please you?” inquired Margery, kneeling
for an instant beside her.</p>

<p>“Please me? Nothing on earth could give me greater
pleasure; but I want Nugent to postpone the journey till
his return from the country.”</p>

<p>The earl moved to the window, and was standing with
folded arms. His face wore a puzzled, almost distressed
expression.</p>

<p>“My sister, Miss Daw,” he said, quietly, “is desirous I
should visit my other tenants before starting for Court
Manor, and I am satisfied she is right. I have not been
down for years, but it will not take me long, and
then——”</p>

<p>“And then,” finished Lady Enid, with a feeble smile—“then
good-by to dreary, gloomy, dusty London, if—if
Dr. Fothergill consents.”</p>

<p>“Enid,” Lord Court said, going to his sister’s side,
“what do you mean? Has Fothergill been frightening
you? Ah, I knew there was something that made you
hesitate! Speak! tell me at once!”</p>

<p>“Nugent, my darling”—and Lady Enid imprisoned his
strong hand in her two frail ones—“forgive me! I have
been tempted to tell you, and then the thought of buoying
you up only for bitter disappointment has stopped me.
This is it, my darling.” There was a little catch in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
breath which he did not notice in his anxiety, but which
did not escape Margery, who had risen, and was standing
at a little distance, with hands clasped tightly together.
“For some time past Dr. Fothergill has been hopeful
that, by undergoing certain treatment, I shall be cured—that
is, partially cured—walk by myself, be no longer the
great baby I am now; and—and I have agreed to try it,
for I do long for health, to be as others are. Now, Nugent,
you know my secret—you have wormed it out of
me. I did not mean to tell you, but I have been compelled.
So you see, darling, I cannot leave London while
I am under his care. In a little while I shall know
whether the treatment is successful or not. I have kept
this even from Margery.”</p>

<p>Her cheeks were flushed, a light of eagerness was in
her eyes. Margery could not see for tears; she slipped
her hand into the tiny hot one, and whispered the words
that Lord Court spoke; then, deeply moved, she turned
and left the room.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>


<p>Two days passed, and the earl announced his intention
of going down to his tenants at the end of the week.
They were two peaceful, pleasant days, and Margery
found much to occupy her. She would have remained in
her own room during her spare moments if Lady Enid
would have allowed it, but, with pretty tyranny, the invalid
refused any such concession, and so Margery brought her
painting into the boudoir. Lady Enid seemed never tired
of watching her as she sat bending over her canvas, and
every now and then she would touch her brother gently,
and by a sign call his attention to the girl’s beauty. Margery
liked Lord Court. She was pleased at the graceful
deference he showed her, and happy because of the joy
his presence brought to Lady Enid. He was a most
agreeable companion; his wanderings about the world
had provided him with a fund of anecdote and information,
and Margery listened delightedly to his voice,
though her heart would sink at times at the memory of
that other who had spoken of the same scenes. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
found that the earl was an artist of more than ordinary
ability, and was grateful to him for his many hints, entering
into long discussions with a zest that delighted
Lady Enid. The earl, too, found it a strange pleasure to
listen to her, and he would start a conversation simply
for the sake of hearing her speak, and to watch the ever-changing
expression of her sweet face.</p>

<p>He gave himself up now entirely to his sister; his fears
were banished, her own hopefulness kindled his, and the
delicate flush that appeared on her white cheeks led him
to believe that her strength was returning. Margery, too,
shared his eager delight in Lady Enid’s recovery; yet
amid it all she could not repress a vague feeling of discomfort
sometimes, and alarm would rise unbidden when
she looked up quickly and saw the unspeakable sadness
in Lady Enid’s face; but she kept her fears to herself,
and, indeed, dismissed them as fancies when she heard
the brother and sister laughing and chatting together.</p>

<p>Lord Court was absent a week, but he sent dispatches
daily to town, with hampers of flowers and fruit. The
two girls were ardent lovers of flowers, and Margery
would flit about arranging them till the room was
scarcely recognizable.</p>

<p>On the day of the earl’s return she began the pleasant
task of decorating, and, when all the vases were filled,
she turned to Lady Enid with the great clusters that remained
in her hand.</p>

<p>“Shall I send these up to Lady Merivall, Enid?” she
asked—by Lady Enid’s special desire she discarded the
title when speaking to her friend and mistress.</p>

<p>“Aunt Hannah!” Lady Enid laughed. “Oh, she cannot
bear flowers, Margery! She would declare that we
wished to kill her if we put them in her room!”</p>

<p>Margery buried her face in the flowers.</p>

<p>“How I pity her!” she said, slowly. “To me they are
as life itself. Yet, do you know, Enid, sometimes the
thought comes to me that we are cruel when we cut the
blossoms off so ruthlessly—they die so soon.”</p>

<p>She gazed admiringly at a small, delicate white rose
as she spoke; it looked so desolate without its setting of
green leaves. A curious fancy seized her—was not her
life like this poor flower’s, separated from all she loved?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“She is thinking of her grief,” thought the invalid girl.
“You are too tender, darling,” she said, gently; “flowers
are sent for our use; and, after all, we die as they do.”
She paused a little, and then went on, “I will tell you
where to put those, if you will. Nugent loves flowers as
we do. Ask Morgan to give you some glasses, and arrange
them on his table, will you?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Why did I not think of this before?” and,
gathering them in her hands, Margery went swiftly from
the room.</p>

<p>Lady Enid lay back very still as she disappeared, a
strange yearning look on her face.</p>

<p>“If that only might be,” she murmured to herself, “I
could go in happiness, I think.” She looked toward the
door, and her eyes suddenly gleamed with joy. “Nugent,”
she cried, “you have come back! How good of
you to be so early!”</p>

<p>Lord Court bent and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Where is Miss Daw? You are alone.”</p>

<p>Lady Enid saw his eager glance.</p>

<p>“She has just left me to put some flowers in your
room. Oh, Nugent, how sweet they are! I breathe the
country air again in their scent.”</p>

<p>“As you will breathe it in reality, darling, soon. What
does Fothergill say?”</p>

<p>“I am progressing slowly,” Lady Enid replied, in a
quiet voice, though the flush on her cheeks deepened; “it
must be another week yet, Nugent, before I can think of
starting.”</p>

<p>“A week will soon pass,” the earl responded, tenderly,
not noticing her labored manner—“a week, and then,
Enid, my darling, we shall return to the home where we
were so happy, to the haunts you loved! My life shall
henceforth be spent for you and with you, as of old.”</p>

<p>Lady Enid put her hand on her brother’s.</p>

<p>“You do not dread it?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“All dread is gone—it is buried in the past,” he answered,
firmly, looking into her eyes.</p>

<p>Lady Enid sighed, and Margery entered the room as
he released her hand.</p>

<p>“You have been putting some flowers in my room,
Miss Daw; that is kind of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“I did not know you liked flowers, Lord Court,” she
answered, with the grave smile that never brought any
light to her eyes. “I will remember in future.”</p>

<p>“I like all that is beautiful,” he said, involuntarily;
then, turning to his sister—“Enid, let us celebrate my return.
You have not driven out for weeks. Can you bear
the fatigue to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lady Enid, with a gleam of delight.
“I shall enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“It is a lovely day,” went on the earl. “I long to drag
you from this gloomy room; a drive will do you good, I
am sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it will.”</p>

<p>Margery knelt for an instant beside the couch.</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure?” she whispered. “Will Dr.
Fothergill——”</p>

<p>“He has urged me to go many times,” Lady Enid interrupted,
kissing her; “so run and put on your hat.”</p>

<p>Margery went with a light heart, and in a few minutes
followed the slight figure on its straight, padded board
to the luxurious barouche. Lady Enid’s couch was
placed in the carriage, for she was compelled to retain
her recumbent position, and, with a heart full of pity,
Margery took her seat beside the invalid.</p>

<p>London was very full, considering that the shooting
season had commenced, and many people came to the
side of the carriage, either to bow or to offer their greetings
to Lady Enid. To all of these acquaintances Margery
was introduced as “my dear friend,” and her heart
swelled with gratitude to Lady Enid for her delicacy and
consideration. Lord Court, though he was busy talking,
lost none of the varying expressions that passed across
her face. Gradually it was becoming a pleasure to him
to be near this girl whom his sister loved; he recognized
the rare beauty of her nature, her inborn refinement, and
her pride and grace won from him attentions that many
another woman had sighed for in vain. Margery was
always gratified by his courtesy, though his growing admiration
was lost on her. She sat back in the carriage
listening to the conversation, speaking only when addressed.</p>

<p>The earl had judged rightly—the drive seemed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
brought new life to his sister. She chatted gayly, breathing
the soft air with avidity, and his hope rose higher
and higher as he gazed at her animated face. They had
turned into the park, which was filled with carriages and
equestrians, and Margery, who had been only once before
in this part of London, grew interested in watching the
groups of people passing to and fro.</p>

<p>Lord Court’s eyes wandered from his sister’s face to
hers, and a sense of peace such as he had never felt in the
past four years crept into his heart. Lady Enid saw his
eyes turned on Margery, and she smiled to herself a
happy little smile; she felt that these two would be
friends, and the thought pleased her. Just as they were
turning to leave the park, a gentleman rode up to the carriage
and entered into conversation with the earl and
Lady Enid. Margery sat back, and let her eyes and
thoughts wander. She watched, with a smile on her
face, two children struggling for a doll, heedless of the
voice of their nurse; then suddenly the smile faded, and
her heart seemed to stand still. Beneath the trees to their
right a party of riders was just moving on—a woman
between two men, followed by two grooms. Margery’s
cheeks blanched, and her hands trembled; she knew that
graceful form only too well. It was Vane Charteris—Vane
Charteris, with the smile of content, the glow of
perfect happiness on her lovely face; and beside her rode
Stuart Crosbie. Margery had looked but once, yet she
saw only too well. Vane had turned with a smile to her
lover, and he, bending close to her, was murmuring
words the tenderness of which might have been guessed
by the earnest gaze that accompanied them.</p>

<p>Margery drew back in her seat as they passed; it was
a moment of bitter agony. She had thought herself
schooled to meet sorrow, that she was able to be firm,
that she had cast out all love and despair from her heart,
and filled it with a desire for utter forgetfulness. Now
she saw herself in her weakness. The very sight of Vane
Charteris brought back the humiliation she had suffered,
while the sight of Stuart, the man who had deceived her,
insulted her, wrecked her life at its very beginning,
brought back the tumultuous joy of that evening in the
Weald Wood, the never-ending sorrow of her loss. Ah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
she might be as brave as she would, away, but a glimpse
of his face had broken down all the barriers that pride
had been setting up during these past weeks, and left her
as weak as before!</p>

<p>Turning to speak to her, Lord Court saw her pallor
and look of pain.</p>

<p>“Something is troubling her,” he thought. “She is
too young, too fair to look so distressed.” Ignoring her
apparent faintness, he gave his orders to the footman,
and they were driven home.</p>

<p>Margery all that evening was quiet, almost depressed.
She knew she might have remained in her own room, had
she so wished, but she shrank from being left alone with
her thoughts, from the confession of her own weakness;
and she sat with Lady Enid, who, full of the pleasure of
her drive, chatted and laughed gayly, not noticing her
friend’s changed manner. But, though it escaped her, it
was quickly detected by her brother, and the pale face of
the young girl, the unspeakable depth of sadness in her
eyes, touched him with deep sympathy. He came easily
and gracefully to her rescue. He took the book from her
hand when Lady Enid asked her to read, with a playful
remark as to Miss Daw’s needlework progressing slowly,
and he alone saw the slender figure leaning back wearily
on the wide window-ledge, her work forgotten in her
thoughts. He exerted himself to chat to his sister, and
then, knowing that her evening was never complete without
music, seated himself at the piano, and filled the room
with the melody of a rich baritone voice.</p>

<p>Margery listened a while, then the sighing sadness of
the music proved too much for her, and, stooping to kiss
Lady Enid, she retired to her room.</p>

<p>The night hours passed slowly and heavily; she could
not sleep. Her mind was haunted by the vision of two
forms with the radiance of a great happiness in their
eyes. Was London, then, so small that she must be tortured
by their faces wherever she went? And her secret—would
not that be discovered? They had not seen her
to-day, but who could tell whether she might not meet
them again? She felt low-spirited and disheartened for
a time, then grew gradually easier in her mind. In a
week, perhaps, they would leave London, and down at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Court Manor she would have peace, if not happiness.
Comforted by this thought, she fell asleep just as the
gray dawn was breaking, her troubles forgotten for the
time in dreams.</p>

<p>For the next three days life went on as it had before
Lord Court arrived. Margery took her solitary walks in
the square garden, secure from all fears there, and Lady
Enid declared herself much better. As the end of the
week drew near, Margery felt her heart lighten. Only
a few hours more, and she would be safe for a long
time!</p>

<p>“Have you your canvas and all the necessaries for our
pictures, Nugent?” asked Lady Enid, on the afternoon of
the day before that fixed for their departure.</p>

<p>“I have one or two little commissions to execute this
afternoon,” returned the earl; “then I shall be quite prepared
for work.”</p>

<p>“Let us go with you; it is a lovely day.”</p>

<p>“But the fatigue!” he said, warningly. “Remember,
Enid, there is the journey to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I should enjoy it,” Lady Enid murmured, a little
plaintively.</p>

<p>“Then come, by all means, my darling.”</p>

<p>With a beating heart, Margery put on her hat; fain
would she have stayed at home, but she could think of
no excuse, and she did not like to spoil Lady Enid’s
pleasure. She shrank from the idea of seeing those two
faces again, and the chance of being recognized.</p>

<p>The earl was waiting for her at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Enid has sent me for you, Miss Daw,” he said, hurriedly,
“but I was most anxious to speak to you for a
minute alone. Tell me honestly, do you think she wishes
this journey to-morrow? Sometimes I fancy I see a
hopeless longing in her eyes, and it almost makes my
heart ache.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Lord Court,” Margery answered, earnestly,
“I am sure Lady Enid lives in the very thought of going
to her old home. She has talked of it so often. Please
do not distress yourself; I have seen that look in her eyes,
too, but I do not think it means more than a longing to
be well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>She put out her hand timidly, and he raised it to his
lips.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, gently; “you always comfort
me, Miss Daw.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met for an instant, and he saw again the
deep sadness in hers.</p>

<p>“Enid is waiting,” he said; “let us go to the carriage.”</p>

<p>This time they drove through the streets, and Margery
forced herself to talk and smile, though she was trembling
with fear. If her smile died away suddenly, and if
her voice had not the true ring, it was only the earl who
remarked it. Lady Enid, lying back on her couch, was
too interested in all that was passing to see the effort and
notice the constraint.</p>

<p>At last all the commissions were executed, and it was
with a sigh of relief that Margery found the carriage
was rolling homeward.</p>

<p>“Shall I ever learn her sorrow?” the earl wondered,
as they bowled along, noting her sweet face. “It is only
one who has suffered as I have who looks as she does—yet
that is impossible in her young life.”</p>

<p>Margery met his earnest, questioning gaze; the color
rose to her cheeks, and she was about to make some remark,
when suddenly, to her amazement, the earl leaned
forward and pulled her on one side; then followed a
sharp shock to the carriage. Dimly she saw a huge impending
mass above her, and heard voices raised in
alarm; then her senses cleared, and she saw the earl
standing in the street, the footman beside him, and a
crowd of people hurrying forward.</p>

<p>“There is no damage,” cried the earl, getting into the
carriage again—“at least, none to us. You are not hurt?”
His tone was intensely eager.</p>

<p>“No, no,” Margery answered, quickly; “but Lady
Enid——”</p>

<p>“Is all right. She told me so herself, with a smile,
just this minute.”</p>

<p>Margery bent over the couch.</p>

<p>“Then she deceived you,” she said, hurriedly, looking
up with blanched cheeks; “for she has fainted.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>


<p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck eight in clear,
silvery chimes; Margery paused in her walk to and fro
in the boudoir, and looked at it. Three hours since they
had returned, and carried Enid’s poor, fragile form to
the bedroom, her face as white as death itself. The
agony of Margery’s suspense was unbearable; she had
been alone, listening for, yet, she scarcely knew why,
dreading to hear Dr. Fothergill’s step on the stair. All
thought of self was banished now; she could think only
of the sweet angel-woman who had been a spirit of goodness
to her, and of the look of speechless grief on the
earl’s face as he carried his sister into the house. Downstairs,
in another room, a man was sitting, with head bent
forward as with age. It was the Earl of Court. He had
returned from his sister’s couch, after placing her there,
and, dropping into the chair beside the fire, had never
moved during the three weary hours that passed. He
heard the doctor slowly descend the stairs; yet he, like
Margery, dared not approach him because of the unspeakable
dread that was in his heart, and he heard the
street door close with a slight shudder at the fears that
possessed him.</p>

<p>It was not till the door was gently opened that he
roused himself from his trance of despair; then, raising
his head, he saw Margery, pale and agitated, standing
before him.</p>

<p>“Enid wishes for you,” she said, faintly.</p>

<p>He started to his feet in an instant.</p>

<p>“You have seen her?” he murmured.</p>

<p>“No,” Margery shook her head. “I will come after
you; she has asked for us both, and——” She stopped—her
voice failed her.</p>

<p>The earl pressed his hands over his eyes, and followed
her from the room.</p>

<p>Lady Enid was lying back on her pillows, very pale
and faint. She could not move her hand as her brother
entered, but he saw the look of pleasure that illumined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
her face. He bent low over her, and heard her voice
come only in a whisper, and that with a painful effort.</p>

<p>“You are better, Enid?” he murmured, hoarsely. “Oh,
say you are better, my darling!”</p>

<p>“I shall be soon, Nugent,” she answered. “Have you
seen Dr. Fothergill?”</p>

<p>He shook his head, and he thought he saw a look of
pain gather on her face.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she said, faintly, “for I must tell you
myself.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what, Enid?” he asked, his voice almost inaudible.</p>

<p>She did not answer at once, but after a while she
raised her weak hand and passed it over his brow.</p>

<p>“Nugent,” she faltered, her tones a little clearer, “I
want you to give me a promise, dear.”</p>

<p>“Need you ask for one?” he answered, pressing her
hand to his lips, then clasping it firmly within his own.</p>

<p>“I want you to be a friend to Margery; she has no one,
and I love her. Nugent, my darling, do not look at me
like that—there is no hope. Oh, don’t cry, my own dear
brother! Listen! I have deceived you”—her voice grew
fainter—“I have been growing weaker and weaker every
day. This is the finish.”</p>

<p>The earl had sunk upon his knees; his face was almost
hidden. Lady Enid’s hand, wandering over his hair,
touched his eyes—they were wet with tears.</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t! Oh, Nugent, you break my heart!”</p>

<p>He was up again in an instant, his grief repressed by
an iron will.</p>

<p>“You promise?” she said, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I promise all you ask,” he answered. “Oh, why cannot
I die, instead of you?”</p>

<p>“You must live and keep your promise,” Lady Enid
whispered; then she closed her eyes for a minute, and, in
despair, he beckoned to the maid to moisten the pale lips.</p>

<p>The heavy lashes were raised, and the girl’s eyes smiled
again.</p>

<p>“I have one great, great wish,” she murmured, faintly.</p>

<p>“It is granted. What would I not do for you, Enid?”</p>

<p>“Make Margery Daw your wife!”</p>

<p>The earl started, and his color deepened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“If she consents,” he answered, after a moment’s pause,
“I will.”</p>

<p>“She is so good—ah, Nugent, you do not know how
good! I have grown to love her as a sister. She will
watch over you for my sake—when I am gone!”</p>

<p>She lay back silent for a minute, then turned her eyes
on her maid.</p>

<p>“Ask Miss Daw to come now.”</p>

<p>The earl moved away and buried his face in his folded
arms on the mantelpiece. Margery came in softly, then,
with one deep sigh, crouched beside the bed and put her
lips to the thin hands.</p>

<p>“Margery,” whispered Lady Enid—“my dear Margery!”</p>

<p>“You are better—oh, tell me you are better, Enid!”
faltered Margery.</p>

<p>“Darling, listen to me. I am dying. My poor Margery,
be brave. I have known it a long time; the shock
to-day has—has—only hastened it. But I want you to
do something for me. Margery, do not promise till you
have heard what it is. Nugent!” The earl came to her
with slow steps. “You shall not be left alone, Margery,
when I am gone. Margery, you have loved me—you
know all; I want you to be my brother’s wife!”</p>

<p>Margery drew back for an instant, and stood with
her hands pressed against her bosom, her mind distracted,
the words just uttered ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>Could she link herself to one whom she could never
love, though she deeply respected him? Could she give
herself to another while she believed herself pledged to
Stuart Crosbie forever? Her eyes met the sweet brown
ones, already dim with pain, turned wistfully upon her.
A flood of pity filled her; she dropped upon her knees,
and breathed:</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Lady Enid waited a moment; then, grasping Margery’s
hand, she held it toward the earl, and across her
bed the compact was sealed.</p>

<p>“There is one—thing more,” she whispered, with difficulty;
“the—end may be soon. I could die—happier if—if
you were made man and wife now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>The earl was silent; but Margery raised her head,
her cheeks as pale as those lying on the pillow.</p>

<p>“It shall be so,” she said, clearly; “be comforted.”</p>

<p>The earl stooped, and pressed his lips to his sister’s;
a sigh burst from his overcharged heart.</p>

<p>“As Margery says, I say; we will be married here in
the morning. I will arrange it.”</p>

<p>Then, without another word, he passed out of the
room.</p>

<p>Margery hardly moved all through the long, terrible
night that followed. Lady Enid held her hand within
her own, and, fearful of disturbing her few moments of
slumber, Margery did not stir, though she grew faint and
stiff as the hours passed. What were her thoughts during
the interval? She could not have told; but the
dominant feeling was one of bitter grief, an agony of
regret and sorrow as she looked at the pale young face
with the seal of death already upon it. The promise
she had given did not come home to her in those silent
moments; she was striving to gauge the depths of Enid’s
great and noble nature. How brave, how strong she
had been, with the knowledge that she was doomed, ever
present in her breast! What courage had filled that
poor, fragile frame, what an infinity of love that feebly-beating
heart! Ah, what a lesson was it to the girl
crouched in that sickroom to bury self and live for
others!</p>

<p>Toward early dawn—the girl was worn out with fatigue
and sorrow—Margery’s eyes closed; and, with her
wealth of red-gold curls spread over the coverlet, she
slumbered peacefully. Lady Enid woke early. She was
faint, even weaker than the night had left her; yet, as
she saw the daylight creep into the room, her heart almost
leaped with joy—her mind was at rest. Her eyes
lingered with tenderness on Margery’s tired head; and,
as the first rays of the morning sun touched the luxuriant
tresses of hair, making them as a ruddy, golden halo, she
murmured: “Nugent will be content by and by,” and lay
back, waiting till her maid or Margery should awake.</p>

<p>The sun was well up before Margery raised her heavily-fringed
eyelids; but, once aroused, she was angry
with herself for sleeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“My sweet Margery,” whispered Lady Enid, “my poor,
tired darling!”</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” murmured Margery.</p>

<p>“Forgive you! You were worn out. Listen, darling!
Nugent will be here soon. Go to your room, and put
on a white gown.” She smiled faintly. “I—I wish it;
you shall have no bad omens at your wedding, Margery.
Pauline, attend mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>Margery hesitated, and then obeyed silently.</p>

<p>“Heaven give me strength!” prayed Enid, as she felt
herself growing faint. “But this one thing, this marriage
over, and I shall die content.”</p>

<p>Margery went to her room, and listlessly allowed the
maid to wave her hair and adjust the simple white cambric
dress; but her hands were trembling and her senses
numb. A wedding! It seemed like a dream. The
prayer book the maid handed her recalled her to the reality;
and with faltering steps she went back to the
dying woman.</p>

<p>Three men were in the room as she entered, but she
was scarcely conscious of their presence. She went
straight to Lady Enid, and sat down beside her, her hand
clasped in hers, her head bowed.</p>

<p>Then she felt herself raised to her feet, she saw Dr.
Fothergill bend and put a vial to Enid’s rigid lips, and
the next minute a solemn voice sounded through the
room, and the marriage service began. Margery felt
her hand clasped in a firm hold; she uttered her responses
in a voice that sounded far away; but her eyes
never left the pale face lying back on the pillows, with
a gleam of joy in the sweet eyes.</p>

<p>The ceremony was over, the blessing was spoken, and
together Lord Court and his wife knelt beside Enid’s
bed to catch the faint whispers that fell from her pallid
lips; they saw her eyes gaze into theirs with a glow of
heavenly radiance, they saw her hand move feebly toward
them, they seemed to hear the prayer uttered for their
happiness; and then the dying girl’s eyelids drooped, a
fluttering sigh escaped her lips, her head fell forward,
and—Margery knew no more.</p>

<p>Nugent, Earl of Court, saw the servants bear his wife
from the room; but he remained kneeling by his sister’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
body, gazing on the calm, marblelike face, the still form
of her he had loved so well.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Vane Charteris was astonished beyond words when
she found that the assertion she had made regarding
Margery’s voyage to Australia in company with Robert
Bright and her so-called father was absolutely confirmed
by fact. Nothing could have been more opportune, no
more satisfactory <i>dénouement</i> to the whole affair could
have taken place had she arranged it herself. It had
needed only jealousy to finish what she had begun; and
its poison now rankled in Stuart Crosbie’s heart. He
was stunned, almost overwhelmed by Margery’s apparent
treachery and heartlessness. He did not know, he
had never fathomed till now, how greatly he had loved,
what a flood of passion had overtaken him. Margery
had been the sun of his existence, and she was gone—worse
than gone—she was faithless!</p>

<p>Vaguely he repeated the words over and over again,
as he sat listlessly in a chair looking out over the fair
landscape, but seeing it not. Faithless! The girl who
had kindled the glow of all earthly bliss, the girl who
had seemed a very angel of purity and beauty, was false!
While he held her clasped in his arms and breathed his
earnest, sacred vows of love, she was false! As she
smiled in radiant tenderness and whispered back her
own, she was false! Through it all she had been false!
It was inconceivable; it was maddening!</p>

<p>A fortnight wore away, but Stuart’s mood did not
alter; he sat silent and morbid, trying to understand
it all, to get at the truth. Vane grew a little troubled at
his manner—she had not imagined the wound would
have been so deep. Her own shallow nature could not
comprehend the depths, the intensity, the passion of love.
To her it had appeared that Stuart would of course be
angry. As a proud man, that was but natural, and she
had expected to see him defiant, hard, reckless. This
strange silence, this quiet misery amazed and annoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
her. But she was outwardly at her best all this time.
She never spoke to her cousin respecting their former
confidences. She made him feel rather than know the
depths of her womanly sympathy, thus making her
worldly tact appear as innate refinement and tender delicacy.
She moved about as in harmony with his gloomy
thoughts; her laughter never jarred; her voice often
soothed him; and last, but not least, she warded off any
attacks from Mrs. Crosbie, whose brow contracted in
many an ominous frown because of what she termed her
son’s folly and want of dignity.</p>

<p>It was tedious work sometimes, and Vane often grew
vexed and weary; but this gloom could not last, she
told herself; there would come a day when Stuart would
rouse himself and cast aside all thought of his dead love,
trampling on the memories of it as on a vile and worthless
thing. She must not fail now, seeing that she had
succeeded so well hitherto. But a little patience, and she
would win—she must win, not only for her love’s sake,
but for her ambition. News had reached her of the
marriage of one of her most detested rivals, a girl
younger than herself. She could not face the world
again without some weapon in her hand to crush the
woman she hated and bring back her lost power. It was
as Stuart Crosbie’s wife that she determined her triumph
should come. He bore no title; but his name was as
prominent as any in the land, his wealth would be untold,
and, as <i>chatelaine</i> of Crosbie Castle and Beecham
Park, her social position would be undeniable. Even
Mrs. Crosbie did not guess the fire that burned beneath
Vane’s calm exterior; but her desire for the marriage
was certainly as great in one way as her niece’s. Lady
Charteris, who had by this time recovered from her surprise
at her daughter’s strange freak in staying so long
at the castle, saw nothing, but chattered and slumbered
away her days placidly enough, content to know that
Vane was happy.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Gerant had disappeared as strangely and
as suddenly as he had arrived. Two days after the
eventful drive to Chesterham he took his departure,
greatly to Miss Charteris’ and Mrs. Crosbie’s satisfaction.
There was something in his dry, cynical manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
which made them singularly uncomfortable, and their
strict ideas of etiquette were greatly disturbed by his
many unorthodox acts. Stuart, at any other time, would
have regretted his cousin’s departure; but now it made
but little impression on him, and, while he exerted himself
to bid him farewell, his mind was with his trouble,
and as Sir Douglas walked away, he gave himself up
again to his unhappy thoughts.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed uneventfully, and then Sir Douglas
reappeared as suddenly as he had left. Mrs. Crosbie
met him with profuse but insincere words of welcome.
She was just enough to recognize how much he had
done for Stuart. Sir Douglas put aside all her gracious
speeches.</p>

<p>“It is only a flying visit,” he said, tersely. “I want
to have a few words with Stuart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry you will not stay,” Mrs. Crosbie
responded. “I had hoped you had come for the shooting;
Sholto expects a few guns down. We should have
had a party for the twelfth of August but for Stuart’s
accident. Can I not persuade you?”</p>

<p>“I should yield to your persuasion, cousin,” answered
Sir Douglas, with an old-fashioned bow and a gleam of
merriment in his keen gray eyes—he knew right well
he was no favorite with madam—“but that unfortunately
time and tide wait for no man, and I sail for the
antipodes at the end of the week.”</p>

<p>“The antipodes!” cried Mrs. Crosbie; and she would
have questioned him further but that he ended the interview
by walking away in search of Stuart.</p>

<p>He found the young man strolling listlessly about the
grounds, attended by all his canine pets. There was no
doubt as to the sincerity of the pleasure on Stuart’s face
when he saw his cousin; but Sir Douglas was quick to
notice the worn look and the gloom that almost immediately
settled again on his features.</p>

<p>“How is the arm?” he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>“Mending rapidly,” Stuart answered. “I shall have
it out of the splints in another fortnight.”</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry it,” said Sir Douglas, as he turned and
strolled beside the young man; “it was a nasty fracture,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>They walked on in silence until they reached a quiet
spot, and then Sir Douglas halted.</p>

<p>“Stuart,” he said, “I have come down here on purpose
to see you. I want you to give me a promise.”</p>

<p>“It is already given,” Stuart answered, roused from
himself for a while, and stretching out his hand.</p>

<p>“You know that I have made you my heir, that I have
willed all I possess to you with certain conditions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Stuart answered, his face flushing a
little. “Do not think me ungrateful if I say I wish it
were not so. I do not want your property; I——”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that,” interrupted Sir Douglas, dryly.
“If you had wanted it, you would not have had it. But
it is not of that I want to speak; it is of the conditions.
They are more to me than any fortune you could name.”</p>

<p>“Whatever they are, I accept them willingly, with all
my heart, and, if it be in my power, they shall be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>Stuart spoke firmly, his eyes as steadfast as his words.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Stuart,” responded Sir Douglas, quietly.
“I felt—I knew you would answer me so.” He paused
a little, then went on slowly. “I leave England again
at the end of the week on a search that has lasted my
lifetime—hopeless, alas, in the years that are gone, but
touched now with the blessedness of hope! Yes, thank
Heaven, I have a clew!”</p>

<p>Stuart looked in wonder at his cousin’s face; it was illuminated
with color, and there was an unusual glow in
the eyes.</p>

<p>“I cannot bring myself to speak to you now, Stuart,
on this subject; but if I am successful, I will open my
heart to you; if not, and anything should happen to me,
this letter”—taking an envelope from an inner pocket—“will
tell you all—will give you the secret of my life.
Guard it well, and, if the time should come soon, swear to
do what I have asked you in it.”</p>

<p>“I swear,” said Stuart, solemnly, his hand closing over
the letter.</p>

<p>“Now I start with a lighter heart than I have had
for years. The days will pass quickly, and, when I
reach Australia, who knows——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“Australia!” broke in Stuart, his face drawn and pale.
“You are going to Australia?”</p>

<p>“I said at the end of the week. What is it, Stuart?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that I were free to go with you!” muttered
Stuart.</p>

<p>Like a flame of fire, the word “Australia” had set the
passion of jealousy running through his veins, calling up
the dormant longing for revenge that had found a resting-place
in his heart. Could he not leave all that distressed
and oppressed him, and rush away to that distant
land, to face him who had stolen the most precious jewel
of his life, to bring shame on her who had deceived and
tricked him? The picture of Margery’s loveliness rose
before him and made his heart beat wildly with the rush
of wrath and love that came over him.</p>

<p>“Stuart,” Sir Douglas said, quietly, almost tenderly,
“I would ask you to go with me gladly but for one thing—you
are not free—your father needs you. He could
not live without you; go from him, and he will sink
before your return. He is not strong; this summer, he
has told me many times, has tried him terribly, and
your accident was a shock.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right,” responded Stuart, gloomily, after
a moment’s pause. “I will stay here. And yet it is
hard.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas did not catch the last words.</p>

<p>“I have always loved Sholto,” he said, “and to rob him
of you would be cruel. No, Stuart, your place is here.”</p>

<p>They moved on and approached the house; but before
they entered, Sir Douglas stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>“Heaven bless you, lad!” he said, tenderly. “We may
never meet again. May you have all the happiness and
sunshine in your life that a man such as you ought to
expect! Remember your promise.”</p>

<p>“I have sworn, and I will keep it.”</p>

<p>They returned to the castle; and, soon after that, Sir
Douglas Gerant left for London.</p>

<p>His cousin’s visit broke the spell of Stuart’s morbid
inactivity. The monotonous quiet of Hurstley seemed
suddenly to appall him. He could no longer sit and
nurse himself; he was restless, almost feverish in his
movements. He went out early in the morning and did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
not return till the day was spent; and, though he tried
to banish every memory of his brief dream from his
mind, Vane detected the nervous restlessness in his face.
In her heart she rejoiced at these signs of awakening;
they were but the forerunners of that proud, contemptuous
mood which she had longed to see reveal itself. Life
was dull at the castle; but, though she yawned and was
inexpressibly bored, she did not intend to give way; and
at last she had the satisfaction of feeling that success
was hers when her aunt announced that Stuart wished
the whole party to leave Crosbie and go to London.</p>

<p>If he remained much longer at Hurstley, Stuart said
to himself, the monotony and inactivity would drive him
mad. So, to Vane’s and his mother’s delight, he proposed
a fortnight’s stay in town, a round of theatres,
and such gayeties as a slack season offered, and then a
return to the castle with a large party for the shooting.</p>

<p>It was then that Vane began to reap her reward.
Stuart seemed to remember all she had done for him,
all her thoughtfulness, gentleness, womanly kindness;
and it was to her he turned in a frank, friendly fashion,
which at once delighted her and deceived her by its ring
of apparently genuine forgetfulness.</p>

<p>To London they all went, save the squire, and, in leaving
him, Stuart thought of his absent cousin’s words;
but it was only for a fortnight, and then he would be
back again, brave in forced courage, steady in his pride,
to walk over the very ground wherein his whole love
lay buried.</p>

<p>It was a delightful time to Vane; she rode, walked,
went sight-seeing, with Stuart always in close attendance,
and, though few of her acquaintances were in town,
she noticed with pleasure that some of her “dear friends”
were passing through London on their way from the
Continent to the country, and she left them to draw
their own conclusions as to her relationship with Stuart
Crosbie. As for Stuart, he lived for the moment in a
whirl of forced excitement and pleasure. He determined
with reckless swiftness to give way to sorrow no more;
he buried the memory of Margery, and set his foot, as
he thought, firmly on the grave of his love; he even
thrust recollection from him; he laughed, rode, chatted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
with Vane, and gradually her influence made itself felt.
If, in the night, visions of his love floated through his
dreams, pride in the morning dispelled his weakness by
recalling her falseness; and he turned to Vane as a
woman whom, though he could never love, he could respect
and trust. To the world his devotion had but one
name, that of a suitor; and, heedless of people’s tongues,
heedless of Vane’s triumphant eyes, Stuart went on his
way, living for a time in a dream of reckless excitement
that would soon pass and leave him plunged in as deep
an abyss of despair as before.</p>

<p>It was in one of these moments that Margery had seen
him beneath the trees, bending his handsome head to
gaze into Vane’s eyes. The action meant nothing to
him—Vane was his cousin, his confidante, his friend.
Had his gaze but wandered to the carriage drawn beside
the rails, and rested on the sweet face, pallid and drawn
by the agony of pain that had come to her, he would have
forgotten his cousin’s existence, and rushed with a madness
of joy, a delirium of happiness, to Margery’s side.
But Margery was unseen; the cousins paced by slowly,
and the image of that face, that form with the right arm
still hung in a sling, those eager eyes, was graven on
her memory in characters the clearness of which tortured
her, and the steadfastness of which nothing could remove.</p>

<p>Margery moved dreamily; she opened her eyes. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
flood of glorious sunshine filled the room. She felt
strangely weak; her hands were almost numb, her head
was heavy; she could do nothing but lie back and rest—rest,
and listen to the sound of a rich voice singing,
somewhat near, a plaintive, sighing song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“You do not love me—no;</div>

<div class="verse indent3">Bid me good-by, and go.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Margery moved again. This time her eyes wandered
round the room; it was strange to her. Where was
she? What place was this?</p>

<p>While a look of perplexity and pain was dawning on
her pure, pale face, some one bent over her.</p>

<p>“Miladi is better?”</p>

<p>“Where am I?” asked Margery, faintly.</p>

<p>“Miladi has been ill,” replied the quiet, soothing voice—“very
ill. She is by the sea now. Does not miladi
hear the waves?”</p>

<p>A faint rippling sound was borne in on the silence,
mingling with the song without.</p>

<p>“The sea!” murmured Margery, vaguely. “Where?
Am I dreaming?”</p>

<p>“Miladi does not forget me? I am Pauline.”</p>

<p>“Pauline!” repeated the girl, striving to dispel the
dense cloud that shrouded her memory.</p>

<p>“Yes, miladi. I dressed you for your marriage that
sad, sad morning.” Pauline spoke slowly. “Can miladi
not remember now?” she added, softly.</p>

<p>Margery looked at her strangely and intently.</p>

<p>“I can remember nothing—I seem to be in a dream.”</p>

<p>She put up her left hand to push back the clusters
of her hair, and as it fell again to the silken coverlet
she gazed at it intently. It looked frail and white, and
on the third finger was a ring—a plain, wide band of
gold.</p>

<p>The maid touched her hand.</p>

<p>“It is miladi’s wedding ring,” she said, divining the
thoughts of wonder and the speculation that were filling
Margery’s mind.</p>

<p>“My wedding ring!” echoed the girl, still wonderingly.
“Am I married, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>Pauline looked at her mistress in alarm. Had the
fever really touched her brain? She almost feared it.</p>

<p>“Miladi will remember,” she whispered, tenderly.
“She was married one morning so early, by Lady Enid’s
deathbed. Miladi has been ill—delirious since—but she
is better now. Miladi must think—must try to remember
now for milord’s sake.”</p>

<p>“By Lady Enid’s deathbed!” whispered Margery; then
the cloud vanished suddenly from her memory, and, with
bitter pain, she remembered all.</p>

<p>Pauline stood by, distressed, yet relieved, as her mistress
put her two thin hands to her face and the great
tears rolled through the slender fingers—the weeping
might agitate for a time, but it would do good in the
end. For three weeks Margery had lain between life
and death. Her overwrought mind and body had given
way suddenly beneath the shock of Lady Enid’s death;
she had been so tired, so shaken by her former trouble
and despair, that the excitement of her marriage, the
supreme agony when she realized that the sweet friend
and sister had passed away, were too much for her, and
she sunk beneath the weight. Nugent, Earl of Court,
sat and watched beside her couch. He saw the struggle
that took place between the terrible fever and Margery’s
delicate yet healthy constitution, not daring to give words
to his fears. She knew nothing during those days—her
lustrous eyes met his unmeaningly. She was his wife,
the treasured bequest of his dying sister; but all his devotion,
his tenderness, the greatness of his new passion
for her, was unknown—her mind was a blank.</p>

<p>When the fever passed away she grew better in body,
but the vacant look lingered in her eyes, and her memory
had not returned. The doctors spoke hopefully, and ordered
a change of air, and so they removed her to the
seaside, and waited for the moment to come when the
dark cloud which obscured her mind would lift, and she
would be the Margery of old. For a week there was no
improvement, but on this day nature seemed to wake
from its trance, and, when Pauline spoke, as she had
spoken many times before, the veil fell, and Margery’s
memory came back to her.</p>

<p>Presently the tears stopped, her hands fell to her side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
and she raised herself feebly into a sitting position. She
was not in bed, but dressed in a loose, white silk gown,
resting on a couch. She looked around, critically taking
in the costly appointments of the room. Pauline watched
her curiously, and noted each sign of pleasure that flitted
across the lovely, pale face.</p>

<p>“It is beautiful,” Margery declared, after a time; “and
the sea is there”—pointing to the large bay window
through which the sunlight streamed. “I will look at
it, Pauline; I have never seen the sea.”</p>

<p>The maid passed her arm round the slender figure, and
guided it to the window, pushing forward a large, luxurious
chair as they reached it, into which Margery sunk
with a sigh of fatigue. She closed her eyes for one
minute, then opened them on a picture of such new, such
wondrous, startling beauty that her pulses thrilled with
the momentary delight.</p>

<p>It was the sea—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“The sea, the sea, the open sea—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The blue, the fresh, the ever free!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Everything was forgotten in that moment’s supreme
pleasure. She had conjured up visions of the ocean,
fed by pictures she had seen; but no canvas could ever
portray the boundless dignity, the majesty, the rippling
beauty of the sea as it appeared to Margery on that October
afternoon.</p>

<p>Margery gazed and gazed, her wonderment growing
greater as she looked, and her mind flew back to the afternoon
when Stuart had spoken of the sea, dwelling on
its beauties so lovingly that she thought she had realized
it in all its grandeur and majesty. Now she knew
that not even his tongue could convey a true idea of its
mightiness. She sat very silent, watching the rolling
waves; the song without had ceased, and Pauline had
retired to the further end of the room. Suddenly the
weird sadness of the sea’s music struck a chord in her
heart. It seemed to be singing a dirge, and her mind
woke again to its load of sorrow. For the first time
the real facts of her marriage came home to her. A look
of despair gathered in her eyes, her thin white hands
were pressed to her lips. Enid—dear, sweet Enid—was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
gone! The brief friendship, strong as though it had
been cemented by years, was broken, and she was alone,
alone with her husband, a man whom she had pitied, respected,
liked, but a man whom she could never love, to
whom she must ever wear a mask, for love was dead
within her to all but one, and for that one it lived as
strongly as of yore. What had she done? Bound herself
for life, given a sacred vow, while every pulse in her
thrilled for that other man, despite his cruelty and his
humiliating insults! Oh, that she had spoken openly to
Lady Enid! This marriage then would never have taken
place. But her silence had produced this result; the sister’s
tenderness, the friend’s affection, had prompted the
dead woman to speak her wish, and at such a moment
Margery had yielded. She did not regret her promise
to Enid. The thought that her marriage had soothed
the dying came almost as a gleam of pleasure. It was
for her husband’s sake she sorrowed, and for her own.
Could aught but misery follow such a hasty union?
Would not they both repent in bitterness and despair?</p>

<p>Margery rose slowly from her seat, feeling weak and
wretched. The spirit of the sea, entrancing at first, had
brought with it a host of sad thoughts that destroyed
its beauty, and made her shudder at its music.</p>

<p>Pauline had retired quietly from the room. Margery
did not notice her absence; and, as she regained her
feet and put one hand on the chair to steady herself, she
said, faintly, with half a smile:</p>

<p>“You must help me, Pauline. I am very foolish;
but——”</p>

<p>A hand clasped hers—not Pauline’s, but a firm, strong
hand. It was her husband’s.</p>

<p>Lord Court drew the slender, white-robed figure gently
to his arms.</p>

<p>“It is not Pauline, my darling; it is I. Nay, do not
look so frightened! You are still very weak, my poor
one! Pauline came to bring me the good news that you
had recovered your memory, and I hastened to you at
once—my wife—my sweet one!”</p>

<p>Margery rested quietly in his arms—she had not
strength to move—but a tumult of thoughts surged in
her brain. Now she must speak, must tell this man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
her weakness, of her love. It must be done now in the
beginning of their married life; she must not delay; it
would be so difficult afterward. And he must know the
truth—know that for Enid’s sake she had uttered words
that should never have been spoken, that would be as
emptiness in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I wish to speak,” she murmured, faintly; but the
words did not reach her husband’s ears. She was nervously
excited, and her strength was already spent.</p>

<p>The earl drew her still closer to his breast.</p>

<p>“Let me hold you in my arms for one instant, my
wife,” he said, tenderly and gravely; “it comes as such a
blessed happiness after weeks of misery and suspense
that I have endured. Margery, my darling, ours was a
strange marriage; but it was tenderly blessed by the
smile of one we both loved. Ah, Enid could read the
heart well! She saw into the very depths of mine; she
knew that its sterile ground had brought forth a pure,
holy plant—my love for you! She saw the misery of
the past banished from my life by the tender influence
of that love, and she realized that life might once more
be made bright and beautiful to me—that earthly trust,
faith and happiness might yet be mine; and so she gave
you, darling, to me, to fill the void her flight would make,
to lead me by your sweetness, your tenderness, to things
better and purer, like your own self.”</p>

<p>A pang of remorse pierced Margery’s heart. Could
she speak, and at one word blast this new-found happiness,
the Heaven-inspired hopes? No, she had not the
courage. She must bury the past. Henceforth Margery
Daw, with all that appertained to her, was banished, and
Margery, Countess of Court, lived in her stead, strong
in the determination to keep her vows and prove herself
worthy of the devotion of her husband.</p>

<p>She raised her pale, lovely face to his, and a steadfast
light shone in her great, blue eyes.</p>

<p>“By Heaven’s help,” she responded faintly yet clearly,
“I will do it!”</p>

<p>Lord Court bent his head, and pressed his lips to hers;
then, lifting her tenderly, he bore her to the couch, and
laid her once more on the pillows.</p>

<p>“You are very frail Margery,” he said, kindly, contemplating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
her as she lay back wearily; “but now you
must make great efforts to get well, and you shall soon
go out and feel the sea breezes on your cheeks—perhaps
they will bring a little color to them.”</p>

<p>“I am always pale,” she whispered, in reply. “How
long have I been ill?”</p>

<p>“A month now. Ah, I had almost begun to despair—you
were so long recovering.”</p>

<p>“And—and Enid?”</p>

<p>“Is at her old home at last,” said the earl, in a constrained
voice. “We carried her down and laid her in
the old churchyard. She always wished to be buried
there.”</p>

<p>“I must go down and see the grave,” murmured Margery.</p>

<p>“When you are able, you shall, my darling. Court
Manor is waiting for its mistress. Ah, Margery, little
did I think years ago that I should so gladly return to
my home, all pain and bitterness rooted out of my heart
forever, and in their place the sweet fragrance of love
and happiness, brought me by a spirit of peace and purity—my
wife!”</p>

<p>Margery moved her head restlessly on the silken pillow;
his deep tenderness and devotion touched her
wounded heart with healing gentleness, yet her burden
was none the less, for she could never repay such great
love, she could never give him what he gave her. Her
pride had suffered such humiliation beneath the cold
cruelty of Vane Charteris’ tongue that her heart might
have thrilled now with satisfaction in the knowledge
that she was—in the world’s eyes—a great person—Countess
of Court, a peeress of the realm. But there
was no pride in her heart. Her husband’s tender words
only brought back with a sudden rush the memory of the
great chasm between them. She drew her hand slowly
from his, with the touch of his lips still clinging to it.</p>

<p>“You know,” she whispered, meeting his gaze with her
great starlike eyes—“you know—Enid told you that I am
quite alone in the world—a waif, a stray?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it, my darling.”</p>

<p>“And you care for me just the same?”</p>

<p>“I love you,” he answered, smiling; “I loved you from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
the very first. Yes, Enid told me your sad story, and it
only binds you still closer to me; henceforth I must be
mother, father, brother, sister, husband, all in one. Do
not hold a thought in your heart that such a circumstance
could make any difference. Remember—</p>

again and again she told herself that she could not destroy
this man’s new-found peace, his life’s happiness.
She must strive to crush all love and remembrance from
her heart, turn her face from the past, with all its store

</div>


<p>Days glided on, and Margery grew gradually stronger.
October was nearing its close, but still the sunshine was
warm and genial, and the wind from the sea soft and
gentle. It was quite a little fishing village where the Earl
and Countess of Court were staying, a rambling, quaint,
three-cornered place, inhabited by healthy, strong-limbed
fisher folk. Lord Court had brought his wife down to
Wavemouth by the advice of two London physicians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
and, when the first week of anxiety was passed, and he
saw signs of returning health on her sweet face, he was
thankful beyond words. The village people were honored
and awestruck by the presence of an earl and countess
in their midst; they had few grand visitors at Wavemouth.
An artist now and then paid the place a visit—indeed,
there was one staying there when Margery arrived.
He sketched the ruddy-faced children and made
his way to the mothers’ hearts by his sweet, clear voice
and gentle manners.</p>

<p>Margery learned afterward that the song she had heard
so clearly that afternoon when she woke to remembrance
had come from this artist’s lips; but she never saw the
singer—he quitted the village soon afterward, and left
the children and maidens lamenting.</p>

<p>Lord Court had brought a low, easy carriage down
with them, and he drove his wife about the picturesque
village, watching with a throb of pleasure the interest
dawn in her face. Wavemouth was so quiet, so peaceful,
so completely in keeping with her desire for rest, that
Margery loved the place.</p>

<p>She was still far from strong, and the sea breezes
brought a sense of relief and freshness to her spirit. She
was fighting a hard battle with herself, striving with all
her might to crush out her old love and turn to her husband,
whose depths of goodness and generosity she was
learning to know better each day. But as she grew
stronger the struggle was more bitter; her thoughts
would fly to Hurstley, to the dead Mary Morris whose
memory she held so dear, and then to that other who
was, despite all her efforts, so inextricably bound up with
her existence.</p>

<p>The earl, totally ignorant of the secret in his wife’s
breast, reveled in his new-found happiness, rejoiced in
the possession of his treasure. Day by day he was
drawn closer to this girl whose sweetness had been sung
by the lips of his dead sister. It was so great a change
to him after those four years of ceaseless pain, distrust
and darkness! Often in those days he had tried to escape
from the remembrance of his life’s mistake; but he
could find no relief till that evening when he stood in
the doorway listening to the sweet, girlish voice ringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
through the room, and then suddenly misery and despair
vanished, and hope revived—hope that afterward became
a sweet reality.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Not by appointment do we meet Delight and Joy—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">They heed not our expectancy;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But round some corner in the streets of life</div>
<div class="verse indent1">They on a sudden clasp us with a smile.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And now Margery was his wife—his very own; there
was none to claim her, none to share the treasure of her
love. Was not this blessing too great? His earnest eyes,
dark with tenderness, were never tired of watching her
lovely, unconscious face as she sat buried in her memories
of the past, the look of unutterable sadness that had
touched him in their earlier acquaintance seeming to him
now caused but by the recollection of her childhood’s history,
her mother’s death.</p>

<p>At last the sunshine died, the sea’s calm was gone, the
tiny rippling movement was changed into gigantic rolling
waves, crested with white foam, and dashing on to the
beach in angry majesty, with a sound as of thunder.
Margery loved the sea in its fury; she would sit and
watch it for hours, her heart beating fast, and her nerves
thrilling at the rage in its fierce waves and dashing spray.
The anger, the wildness of the elements, relieved her
overwrought mind, and the very tumult brought her
peace.</p>

<p>She stood at the window one afternoon gazing at the
expanse of dull, leaden-green water. There were no
waves; it was as if a titanic movement from below agitated
the surface and caused the heavy, sudden motion.
As she stood thus, her husband approached her.</p>

<p>“Not tired of the sea yet, my darling?” he said, with
a smile. “I shall be afraid to suggest a migration if this
devotion lasts much longer.”</p>

<p>“It is so wonderful,” Margery answered, dreamily. “I
can see such strange pictures, imagine such things, as I
watch it. I have never seen it as it is to-day.”</p>

<p>“There will be a storm to-night. I have just seen one
of the fishermen, and he says they expect very rough
weather.”</p>

<p>“It looks an angry, discontented sea,” Margery said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
still dreamily, “as if its passion would be terrible when it
did break forth.”</p>

<p>“Look at the foot of the Templar’s Rock! It is beginning
already; the foam is as white as snow. There is,
as you say, Margery, sullen discontent in its look; but
there is also a wildness of despair. It reminds me, looking
at that whirling rush round the rock, of Tennyson’s
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“‘Break, break, break</div>
<div class="verse indent4">At the foot of thy crags, O sea!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But the tender grace of a day that is dead</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Will never come back to me!’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With a little shudder Margery turned from the window.</p>

<p>“To-day has broken the spell,” she said, hurriedly, with
forced lightness. “I think I am tired of the sea at last.”</p>

<p>“You shall leave it when you will—to-night even, if you
wish it, my darling; it is still early afternoon. I will telegraph
for rooms. Pauline shall accompany you; the
others can remain, with the exception of my man, and
follow to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But it is so much trouble,” began Margery.</p>

<p>“Trouble, my sweet, where you are concerned! You
would like a change? Yes, I see it in your eyes! We
will go, and this, Margery, shall be the beginning of our
married life, henceforth to be spent hand in hand together.
I will go at once and give my orders; we will
start by the first train. I believe there is one about half-past
four.”</p>

<p>“You are so good!” Margery murmured.</p>

<p>He bent, and raised her hands to his lips.</p>

<p>“Never say that again, my darling; my whole life is
for you.”</p>

<p>As he left, and looked at the sea, Margery turned once
more to the window. Yes, she must go.</p>

<p>Suddenly the misery, the weight of her struggle
seemed to overcome her. She had sat and dreamed
much; she must now put aside all dreams, and turn to
life in real earnest. The sea no longer comforted her,
and the words her husband had quoted strengthened the
desire that had been growing within her to leave it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“The tender grace of a day that is dead</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Will never come back to me!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The truth, the agony in those words, struck her with
bitter force. She roused herself with a great effort, determined
to fling aside all her weakness and face her
duty.</p>

<p>The entrance of Pauline checked her musings.</p>

<p>“Miladi is really going!” exclaimed the maid, delight
shining in her great black eyes. “Ah, but I am glad!
Miladi will be so much better away from this dismal
place; it is enough to give one the <i>migraine</i>. Miladi is
wise.”</p>

<p>“You are glad to go, Pauline?” questioned Margery,
smiling, as she watched the maid bring out a costly mantle
and furs for her coming journey.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi, mais oui</i>, miladi! I love London—the sea is
so <i>triste</i>. Miladi will take her jewels with her, <i>sans
doute</i>?”</p>

<p>“My jewels, Pauline! I have none.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mais</i>, how <i>stupide</i>! Miladi has never been even
shown her beautiful jewels! Ah, miladi must see them—they
are <i>magnifiques</i>!”</p>

<p>Pauline brought the richly-inlaid case to a table near,
and spread the contents of the numerous morocco cases
on the cloth. Margery looked at the jewels in silence;
she did not touch one of the glittering rings or bracelets,
or lift the tiara of diamonds from its velvet throne.</p>

<p>Their beauty amazed, but did not please her; ambition
for such things had no place in her nature. She smiled
faintly at Pauline’s delight and many ejaculations.</p>

<p>“Milord had them all brought down from the manor
for miladi. See—she will wear this when she is presented.
Does not miladi like them, and the case with the
arms and the letters of miladi’s name? See—how beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are very beautiful,” replied Lady Court,
quietly; “but I shall not wear them just yet, Pauline.”</p>

<p>“But miladi must put on a few rings above her <i>bague
de mariage</i>—<i>mais oui</i>—just a simple one; it will look
better.”</p>

<p>Margery hesitated; then, hearing a slight noise, she
turned and met her husband’s tender eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“Pauline has been showing me my jewels; they are
beautiful—too beautiful. I thank you for them all. She
tells me that I must wear some rings above my wedding
one. Will you put them on?”</p>

<p>Pauline had disappeared on a murmured pretext. Lord
Court took the slender white hand in his.</p>

<p>“It wants no rings to enhance its beauty,” he said, with
a smile; “but Pauline is right—you must do as others
do, and wear some to guard this band of gold. I have
two that will please you, I think, my darling—two I have
intended giving you for the past week.”</p>

<p>He touched a small spring in the case and disclosed a
little drawer. In this two rings were lying; he took
them out.</p>

<p>“This hoop of diamonds, Margery,” he said, gently,
“was my mother’s; it is old-fashioned now, and perhaps——”</p>

<p>“Let me wear it,” she whispered, hurriedly.</p>

<p>In silence he slipped the circlet over the tiny finger,
then pressed his lips to it.</p>

<p>“This one you know”—taking up the other. “You
have seen it often—the sapphires will match your eyes,
sweet—it was Enid’s ring.”</p>

<p>Tears sprung to Margery’s eyes as she looked at the
glistening stones, and remembered how often she had
seen them flashing on the frail, white hand of the dead
girl.</p>

<p>“They are sacred to me—I shall treasure them both,”
she said, reverently, then turned aside with trembling lips.</p>

<p>Pauline returned in two minutes, and the jewels were
restored to their cases and packed in their iron-bound box
for the journey.</p>

<p>Margery, wrapped in her furs, took her last look at the
sea, its sullen surface already broken by flecks of white.
The vast expanse of dull-green water bordered by the
gray sky struck her suddenly with a sense of gloom.</p>

<p>She turned from it with a sigh of relief; and, as she
left it, determined to banish all the dreams and sad recollections
it had brought her, burying all memories in its
dark, unfathomable depths.</p>

<p>So she went away from the quiet village back to London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and to life, back to duty, firm in her new-born
strength and will.</p>

<p>“Ah, they are happy, milord and miladi, both!” sighed
Pauline to her companion and fellow traveler, the earl’s
valet. “She is so simple and so pretty—and they have
love. Ah, monsieur, how great is that wondrous love!”</p>

<p>The husband and wife sat silent during the greater
part of the journey. Margery, resting her head against
the cushions, sat with closed eyes. The earl thought she
slept, but sleep was far from her. A vague longing
seized her that she might step back into the far distant
past, when she knew neither the greatness of joy nor the
bitterness of sorrow. If she could be once more the simple-minded
girl, living in all contentment her peaceful
village life, her studies the one excitement of her days!
She was happier then, before she had learned the mystery
of her own heart, before childhood had vanished and
womanhood had come in its place.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>


<p>It had been Lord Court’s intention to travel with his
wife straight down to Court Manor, after resting a day or
two in London; but the death of his aunt, Lady Merivale,
immediately on their arrival, necessitated his presence
in town, as her affairs were left in his hands. Margery
at first felt disappointed at the delay, but, after a
week had passed she grew content. They had a suite of
rooms at the Bristol, and, to Pauline’s delight, were in
the very heart of London. Horses and carriages were
brought up for the Countess of Court’s use during her
brief stay, and the slender, black-robed girl, with sweet,
pathetic face, and crown of red-gold hair, provoked universal
admiration. The earl had not many near relatives;
but such of his connections as were in town paid
an early visit to Lady Court, and found their anticipations
of dislike turn to wonder at the gracious dignity
and sweetness of Margery’s presence. She soon learned
that her strange, romantic marriage was the one topic of
the moment in society, that every one was eager to see
the unknown girl who had won the heart of Nugent, Earl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
of Court, so eligible, yet so disappointing a <i>parti</i>. It
gave Margery no pleasure to receive and return the visits
of the stately ladies who claimed to be her husband’s
friends; still, she forced herself to do it, as the beginning
of her path of duty. Every day, as she drove out, she
dreaded to see those two faces whose images she could
not banish from her memory; and she would shrink back
in the corner of the luxurious carriage as she passed a
riding party, forgetful for the minute that her own features
were hidden beneath the thick, black veil, which,
despite all Pauline’s protests, she would wear, forgetful,
too, of the fact that, were she to meet Vane Charteris
and Stuart, they would never associate Margery Daw
with the Countess of Court. For no mention of her
name before her marriage had crept out. The world
knew that the earl had taken his sister’s companion for
his wife, and there its information ended. Miss Lawson
and Dr. Fothergill and his wife were alone in the secret,
and with them it was safe.</p>

<p>One afternoon, at the beginning of the second week of
their stay in town, a trial came to Margery’s pride. Lord
Court was claimed by the lawyers, and, after a morning
spent among her books, Margery prepared for a drive
and some visits. Pauline dressed the slender, graceful
figure in the black garments and fastened the sable mantle
while she uttered exclamations of delight at her mistress’
appearance. She made a slight protest as the veil
was produced, but Margery was firm, and the delicate
face, with its great blue eyes, was completely hidden beneath
the thick folds.</p>

<p>The first visit was to an old marchioness who had
fallen a victim to Lady Court’s charm and sweetness, and
Margery made great progress toward friendship. Several
ladies were present, and from one and all she received
kind congratulations.</p>

<p>“But now I want to beg a favor, dear Lady Court,”
said the hostess, after a while; “it is rude of me, perhaps,
but I hope you will forgive it. Will you not remove
that thick veil? We cannot see your fair young
face, and nature has been so lavish to you, child, you
can afford to be generous.”</p>

<p>Margery laughed softly, and put up her hand to unpin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
the veil, when the door opened, and a voice announced:</p>

<p>“Lady Charteris—Miss Charteris!”</p>

<p>Margery felt the blood surge in her ears and a mist
rose before her eyes; she saw again the beautiful, cold,
cruel creature who had spoken words that stabbed her to
the very heart.</p>

<p>She acknowledged the introduction with a slight bend
of the head, then, murmuring a few words of regret and
farewell, went swiftly from the room to her carriage,
her breast full of stormy emotions.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry you did not see Lady Court; she has
the face of an angel,” said the hostess, as Margery disappeared.</p>

<p>“She is very tall,” observed Vane, in her most bored
manner—“almost too tall for a woman—and she seems
to have red hair. I hate red hair,” she added, a vision
of a sweet, girlish face, framed in red-gold curls, rising
before her as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Your taste, dear Vane, is always good,” observed the
old lady, dryly, and then the conversation drifted into
other channels.</p>

<p>Margery gave her orders in a quiet, stifled voice, and
was driven back to the hotel. The fear, the dread she
had suffered in anticipation of this meeting was as nothing
compared with the agony of pride and pain she now
endured. She had thought herself strong, thought she
was braced for whatever might happen, and at one blow
the barriers she had been building were thrown to the
ground, and she was the broken-hearted, humiliated girl
once again. The sight of Vane recalled all her despair,
and knowledge that Stuart—her love—was lost to her
forever. She sat in deep thought as the carriage rolled
along, and it was not till it drew up at the hotel that she
woke from her meditations. Then, in a moment, came
the memory of her position—of her husband. She was
now far above such insults, and she had one who would
avenge them. The first rush of agitation had died away,
and, when she reached her rooms, she paced up and
down till her mind was restored to tranquillity.</p>

<p>She would be braver in the future, and, if fate forced
her to meet either of those two, she would go through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the ordeal unflinchingly. It would be bitter, she knew,
for, painful as the sight of Vane Charteris had been, it
recalled only wounded pride; with the other her experience
would be different, for the sight of Stuart’s face
would bring back the memory of her unrequited love and
despair.</p>

<p>She threw off her mantle and hat, and turned suddenly
to the piano. In moments of great emotion music
soothed her—it relieved her overcharged heart.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It was a new song, sent in, with many others, by the
earl. Margery played it through, and sang the words
in a low, sad voice, till the passion of the music awoke
a chord within her; and then, as she neared the end, her
tones rang out clear and sweet through the large room.
As the echoes died away, the door opened, and the footman
ushered in a lady. Margery rose quickly, gave
one look, then, with a sudden exclamation of pleasure,
hastened forward and threw her arms round the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Miss Lawson!” she cried, with honest joy. “I am
so glad—so glad to see you once again!”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson kissed the fair cheek in silence, while
tears glistened in her eyes. If ever she had doubted the
warmth, the generosity, the goodness of Margery’s nature
for an instant, the genuine pleasure and affection
of the girl now would have shamed her. She was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
the Margery of old, the sweet, loving Margery she knew
so well.</p>

<p>“You are glad, child?” she said, quietly. “So am I
to see your dear face again; the months have seemed
long since you went, though your letters have told me
all you have done. You are the same Margery; yet you
are changed, dear.”</p>

<p>“I am older and—a married woman,” Margery responded,
with a forced little laugh. “My dignity makes
me older. But come and sit with me. How much I
have to say, and yet I scarcely know where to begin!”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson let her remove her bonnet and cloak and
push her with affectionate hand into an easy-chair in
the inner room, close to a blazing fire. With undisguised
pleasure her eyes rested on the girlish figure. It was
not until Margery had gone from the village that the
rectory governess realized how deeply the waif had crept
into her heart.</p>

<p>“You are not surprised to see me?” she said, after a
while, as Lady Court seated herself on a stool at her
feet.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking of you so much and so often
that you seem part of my life. You are come to stay
with me, dear Miss Lawson? Yes, yes, you must stay;
I shall not let you go.”</p>

<p>“I must return to-morrow; Mrs. Carr will expect me.
I left Hurstley on purpose to see you, Margery.”</p>

<p>“How good of you!” exclaimed Margery, warmly,
fondling the worn hand between her two soft palms.
“This is just what I wanted to complete everything.”</p>

<p>“You are happy?” asked Miss Lawson, abruptly.</p>

<p>“I am content,” answered the girl, and her great blue
eyes met the gray ones with a steadfast look. “And
now tell me all the news. Am I quite forgotten in the
village? Do none of them ask for me in Hurstley?”</p>

<p>“Margery, I will be candid with you. When you first
went I heard very little about you, you know—I seldom
go into the village—but in a very short time the news
came that you had gone to Australia with Reuben and
Robert Bright. The people were hard, dear, and
blamed you. The Brights are heartbroken at Robert’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
leaving them, and all the fault is laid at your door.
They do not speak kindly of you, child, and, when I
first heard them, I had great difficulty in holding my
tongue. But you had begged for secrecy and silence,
and I had given my word. I meant to have written to
or seen you, but then came poor Lady Enid’s death, your
marriage, and your illness. I could do nothing but
wait. I have waited, and now, Margery, I have come
here for the very purpose of asking you to take the seal
from my lips, that I may explain to the village and
silence slander.”</p>

<p>Margery had risen to her feet, her hands pressed to
her bosom, her face deadly pale.</p>

<p>“How cruel the world is,” she murmured, bitterly,
“how terribly cruel! They know nothing, yet they speak
harshly. They do not know how I begged, how I entreated
Robert to go back to his home. You remember
how stunned I was when first I learned that he had
joined Reuben?”</p>

<p>“I know,” answered Miss Lawson, “and I would have
all the world do you justice. You are now great; let
them know you as you are, and crush their calumny. I
do not blame the Brights—their whole life was centered
in Robert—but——”</p>

<p>“And for the rest I do not care,” interrupted Margery,
proudly. “The Brights will hear from Robert
soon, and then they will learn the truth and know how
they have wronged me. What had I done to the village
that at the very beginning of my life they should think
ill of me? Oh, Miss Lawson, is the world all like this?”</p>

<p>“The world is cruel, Margery, bitter, hard,” the elder
woman said, with a sigh; then she added, regretfully, “I
am sorry you will not disclose your secret, but you know
best, dear, and I have done what I considered my duty.”</p>

<p>“You have done as you have done so often—treated
me as though I were your own child—and I thank you.”</p>

<p>“And have you not been my own?” said the elder
woman, with a new light of tenderness on her face. “I
have seen you spring up from a tiny child to womanhood;
I have loved you through all, and I am proud of
you. You are to me what the poet says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<div class="verse indent2">She shall be mine, and I will make</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And nature did that, Margery. No rules of mine
could do what she did. You had the germ within you
of all that makes a grand, good woman, and it has come
to perfection.”</p>

<p>Margery bent and kissed the lips that spoke the grateful
words.</p>

<p>“You always comforted me, dearest, truest friend!
Ah, why will you not stay with me always, to be my
counselor and guide in the years to come? You have
worked so hard; now is your time for rest. Promise
me that when you are tired you will make your home
with me.”</p>

<p>“I will come to you whenever I can, but I will not
live with you. It would not be wise. Now tell me of
all the strange things that have happened since we parted.
Thank Heaven, my child, your lot has fallen upon the
golden side of life! Your troubles are over, now begins
your happiness.”</p>

<p>Margery’s hand had wandered to her heart-shaped
locket, which day and night she always wore. She
raised it, and gazed at the image of her mother’s face.</p>

<p>“It seems like a fairy story,” she said, slowly and
dreamily. “I wonder does the knowledge that I have
so much, that the babe she left alone in the wide, wide
world has great riches and lives in luxury make her
happy?”</p>

<p>“It would make her happier, dear child,” Miss Lawson
added, quietly, “to see that your companion and
friend for life, your husband, is so good and true a man.
He is well known to me, Margery. You see, my sister
has told me all about his nobleness and worth, and from
my heart I congratulate you—more, I rejoice with you.”</p>

<p>Margery did not answer; her hand was still closed
round her locket, her eyes fixed on the fire. The light
flickering and dancing on her pale, lovely face found no
smile there, only a depth of pain in the wondrous starlike
eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>


<p>The fortnight’s stay of the Crosbie Castle party in
town was extended to nearly six weeks; then Stuart escorted
his mother home, and Vane Charteris remained
in London. She was now thoroughly vexed and wearied.
In spite of all her scheming, she was no nearer the goal.
Indeed, she began almost to fear that Stuart would slip
through her fingers altogether. She grew cross and
worried, driving her mother almost frantic by her return
to what she called ill-health. The suspense was
really telling upon her, and with the birth of fear came
strong determination. For her own pride’s sake, she
must win now; the bitter mortification, the humiliation
of failure would be too terrible to bear. Had she not
tacitly encouraged the idea that her marriage with the
heir of Crosbie Castle and Beecham Park was a foregone
conclusion? Already she had experienced the
pleasure of seeing envy and disappointment gather on
several of her rivals’ faces. What barrier now remained?
Stuart had, to all outward appearances, blotted the foolish
episode of Margery Daw from his memory—there
was no other influence to combat hers. Why, then, did
he not wake to the reality and complete her satisfaction?
The delay was annoying, the suspense killing.</p>

<p>Stuart, little guessing the workings of Vane’s mind,
was recovering gradually from the wound that his heart
had received. His reckless mood had gone now, and he
was once more his calm, manly self; but the happy
brightness of his nature was dulled, his light, laughter-loving
ways had fled forever. His love for Margery had
never died; he treasured it now as a beautiful dream, too
great a happiness to be realized on earth. The first
agony of surprise, doubt and grief over, he grew to
judge her as he judged all woman now—he thought of
her, not as Margery, the pure, sweet, fresh young girl,
but Margery the worldly, selfish, artificial coquette, of
the same nature as the fashionable butterflies he met in
town. His love for her was a thing apart from her
memory; he deemed her unworthy of so great, so true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
a feeling; he had worshiped an ideal, and he kept that
ideal still shrined in his heart.</p>

<p>Growing weary of life in town, Stuart went back to
the castle, thankful for the breath of the fresh country
air, the rural quiet. He intended to leave England, to
travel once again, but his father’s worn face recalled
Sir Douglas Gerant’s words, and so, with a little sigh,
he buried his own wishes, and gave himself up to minister
to the parent who loved him so dearly, and whom
he treasured in return. To his mother Stuart was a
puzzle. Never once was Margery’s name on his lips,
yet his undoubted love for her, as revealed in their one
interview, had considerably startled her. She was surprised
at his quietness, his acquiescence in her every
wish, grew uneasy at his sudden gravity and the sadness
of his face, and almost wished for a display of the strong
will which for so many years she had deplored. She,
too, was anxious that his marriage should be arranged,
but had made no remark to him on the subject, deeming
the affair best left in Vane’s able hands.</p>

<p>Stuart had locked the thick letter which Sir Douglas
had confided to his care among the few treasures he possessed,
and he waited, expecting news from his cousin
every day, but none came. At times Stuart grew uneasy;
he saw the announcement of the arrival of the
vessel in which Sir Douglas had sailed, and yet his
cousin made no sign. All he could do was to wait and
hope.</p>

<p>He turned his attention to the business connected with
the lands and estates of Crosbie Castle, and spent long
days with the farmers and laborers, winning their hearts
by his warm, generous nature, and the interest he took
in their welfare. But this state of things displeased
Mrs. Crosbie beyond words. She was an ambitious
woman—she longed to see her son enter the world’s lists
for fame, and to watch him gradually developing into
a quiet farm-owner was more than she could bear. It
roused her pride to think that her son should have the
whole of his life altered through the sentimental folly
of a plebeian romance, and she determined to speak to
him openly upon the subject of his career on the first
opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>It was now about the middle of November, and Stuart
was fully occupied with altering and restoring his cottages
before the severe weather set in. He went out
early and returned late, so that his mother found the
desired opportunity long in coming. At last, one afternoon,
she perceived him striding up the avenue, and,
leaving her boudoir, she met him in the hall.</p>

<p>“Well, mother,” said Stuart, smiling, “not out to-day?
You are wise—it is ankle-deep in mud. Don’t
come near me—I am not fit to approach you. I have
come back for an agreement I made about Cullam’s
cottage; I must be off directly.”</p>

<p>“What is your hurry, Stuart?” asked Mrs. Crosbie,
coldly. “Cannot you spare me a few minutes? I have
long wanted to speak to you, but really you are so much
engaged, I have had no chance.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am ready, mother, if you wish it,” Stuart
replied, though not readily. He never cared for these
brief intervals of conversation with his mother; they invariably
annoyed him.</p>

<p>“Come to my boudoir for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>He followed Mrs. Crosbie in silence; then, as she
closed the door, he walked to the window and leaned
against the ledge.</p>

<p>“Well, mother?” he said, in a tone of impatience.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie stirred the fire, then warmed her white
hands. She looked at her son, and the sight of his grave,
handsome face strengthened her purpose. It was such
a faint likeness to the merry, bright face of a few
months back.</p>

<p>“Stuart,” she began, quietly, “I wish to speak to you
seriously. Do you intend to lead this kind of life always?”</p>

<p>“What kind of life, mother?”</p>

<p>“This dull, monotonous, farmerlike existence. Have
you no aim—no ambition?”</p>

<p>“None,” Stuart answered, laconically.</p>

<p>His mother moved impatiently in her seat.</p>

<p>“Pray, be sensible, Stuart,” she said, sharply; “you
were never like this before. It galls me, it wounds me to
see you wasting your days down here, pottering about on
the farms, and for what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Some one must look after things, mother; my father
cannot, and you have often complained to me of the bad
management, so I have determined to relieve you of further
anxiety.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Do I want my son to turn steward? I have
to-day received a letter from Lady Bayliffe strongly recommending
me a manager, and I have all but settled to
engage him.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t do it,” promptly replied Stuart. “He is
not wanted.”</p>

<p>“He is wanted! I shall not allow you, Stuart, to do
this kind of work.”</p>

<p>“My dear mother, I am of age!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie was silent, and Stuart, looking up, saw
the pain and perplexity on her face.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, mother,” he added, moving toward her.
“I am very selfish. Tell me what you want me to do, and
if it is in my power I will undertake it.”</p>

<p>“I want you to rise in the world; I want you to be
famous, Stuart.”</p>

<p>“Fame is not to be bought, mother.”</p>

<p>“It is within your reach. Contest Chesterham at the
next election. You will be returned with an immense
majority. The rest will follow.”</p>

<p>“I have no brains for politics,” declared Stuart. “I
cannot do it.”</p>

<p>“There is no such word as ‘cannot!’” returned Mrs.
Crosbie, vigorously. “If I were in your place, Stuart,
how differently I would act! You are wasting your life.”</p>

<p>Stuart walked back to the window.</p>

<p>“I will not give you a decided answer now, mother,”
he said. “Give me two days to consider.”</p>

<p>“Willingly,” she agreed, “and weigh all things well.
Remember, you will afford me the greatest happiness in
life if you agree to this and to another wish.”</p>

<p>“To make you happy, mother, I would do much,”
Stuart responded, raising her hand to his lips. “What is
it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“That you will marry.”</p>

<p>“Marry!” repeated Stuart, dropping her hand, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
his face grew white and his brow darkened. “That,
mother, is impossible.”</p>

<p>“I have not spoken to you on this subject before,
Stuart, though it has been one very near my heart. You
have been troubled; but you are not my son if you have
not pride sufficient to drown and wash away forever any
trace of your trouble. It is not for a Crosbie to submit to
insult and humiliation.”</p>

<p>“I submit to none!” retorted Stuart, in a quiet, clear
voice.</p>

<p>“You have been deceived,” his mother declared, coldly
and proudly; “by one who was not worthy even a second
thought.”</p>

<p>“Mother!” he exclaimed, hurriedly, and then stopped.
What could he say in defense of Margery? She was,
indeed, all this. “Your wish is sudden,” he added, after
a pause. “It comes to me quite unexpectedly; but I have
only one answer to it—I shall never marry!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie compressed her lips and turned away.</p>

<p>“Just now you called yourself selfish,” she observed.
“I think you were right.”</p>

<p>“Why should I marry, mother?” he cried, suddenly.
“You know, or perhaps you can never know, what the
past meant to me. I am not a vane to be turned by every
wind. I have loved, and I shall not love again.”</p>

<p>“What has that to do with marriage?”</p>

<p>“I would not ask any woman to be a wife on such
empty terms; it would be a sin. But it is not necessary.
I would do anything, mother, in my power to please you;
but this I cannot.”</p>

<p>“Are you my child?” asked his mother, quietly and
coldly. “Can you waste your whole life, like a misanthrope,
because a village coquette has laughed at and
mocked you? There are good women’s hearts still in the
world, women of our world, who can love and suffer as
such creatures never can.”</p>

<p>“I will offer no woman my life without my love,” declared
Stuart, firmly.</p>

<p>“What would you say if I were to tell you that there
is one who would take it gladly, one who has watched
and worked for you all these months in silence, and who,
through everything, is steadfast and true as steel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie’s hand fell on her son’s shoulder as she
spoke. She felt it was her last card; it might win the
game. Stuart looked into his mother’s eyes; a flush rose
to his face.</p>

<p>“You mean,” he began.</p>

<p>“Your cousin, Vane,” she broke in.</p>

<p>“Vane!”</p>

<p>His mother’s hand slipped from its hold; but he did
not move. He was in a very whirlwind of surprise, pain
and doubt.</p>

<p>“You have not known? No; she hid her secret too
well! There is a woman fit to be your wife—proud, loving,
courageous, a companion to cheer, a helpmate to
stimulate your ambition. Had you not been so blind,
Stuart, you might have seen this. What do you say
now?”</p>

<p>“I can say nothing,” he answered, still in the same low
tones. “This has stunned me. You must let me think,
mother; I have not the power to speak now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, think—and think well,” Mrs. Crosbie said gently.
Something told her that she had won; Vane’s devotion
had touched the right chord.</p>

<p>She watched her son move to the door in silence.</p>

<p>“We will speak of this again another time,” he said,
with constraint.</p>

<p>A wave of compunction passed through Mrs. Crosbie’s
mind when she was alone. Would Vane, after all, bring
him happiness? She had tricked and deceived him. But
this momentary feeling was soon lost in the glad thrill of
ambition that stirred her breast. Stuart married, and in
Parliament, she had nothing more to wish for.</p>

<p>In a maze of troubled thoughts Stuart strode down the
wet paths. Vane loved him; and yet she had put her
own feelings on one side and ministered tenderly,
thoughtfully, kindly to him! What depths of womanly
sweetness in such a sacrifice—what a generous, noble
nature! His heart warmed with gratitude toward her,
though it cooled again as he remembered that she loved
him. What could he do—whither turn in this dilemma?
Vane was dear to him as a friend, as a sister, but not as
the woman he would make his wife. And to make any
woman his wife now, when such sadness darkened his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
life, was almost impossible. What must he do? Could
he let her live on alone, with the sorrow he knew from
experience to be so bitter wearing out her heart? Would
it be a generous return for all she had done, for the noble
tenderness with which she had tried to bring him happiness?
No, no, a thousand times no! If he could no
longer have joy, if gladness were gone forever, he had
still the peaceful pleasure of bringing gladness to another’s
heart. His mother was right—it was his duty to
face the world, and Vane should be his wife.</p>

<p>Even while he thought thus, his brow contracted with
pain, a spasm of undying regret shot through him, the
dream of his first love in all its sweetness returned and
enthralled him once more. It was impossible! He paced
up and down under the wet, dripping trees, trying to
calm the tumult in his breast, with a longing for solitude
and peace one moment, and a piteous thought of Vane’s
great love the next. It was a terrible struggle, and it
lasted through the night hours, never ceasing till the
dawn, when, pale and worn, yet with a steadfast look of
determination about his mouth and in his handsome eyes,
he conquered it. He was brave and strong—sorrow could
not crush him; but Vane—poor, delicate Vane—she
could not endure trouble; and so, if indeed his mother
had spoken aright, he would go to Vane, and ask her to
be his wife.</p>

<p>The gloomy weather in London did not tend to lessen
Miss Charteris’ despondent mood. She was peevish,
bored, discontented, longing to leave England and go to a
warmer climate, yet feeling that she could not give up
her desire and declare herself defeated. She was waiting
only for a week or two to pass, and then she would go
down once more to Crosbie Castle and make a final effort.
This idea was occupying her mind as she sat one dull,
wet afternoon gazing out into the dismal streets, with a
gloomy look spoiling her pretty face. She heard the
door open, but did not stir, imagining it to be her mother.
The stillness that followed caused her to turn; and, looking
around, she met Stuart’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Stuart!” she exclaimed, her face flushing. “You
have given me quite a start! I did not know——”</p>

<p>“I have been watching you for the last two minutes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Vane; you were lost in thought. Whose memory were
you honoring by such deep meditation?”</p>

<p>Stuart looked very handsome, and something in his
manner thrilled her with joy.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of Crosbie,” she answered. “Come to
the fire, Stuart; you must be frozen. And how is Aunt
Constance—and why have you come? I am very glad to
see you.”</p>

<p>Stuart stood silent, slowly removing his gloves; then
he moved nearer to her side by the fire. Vane was looking
lovely; the plaintive sadness of her face, which was
tinged with a delicate flush, touched him. He had read
it well in the first moment of his entrance, and traced, as
he thought, the marks of her trouble.</p>

<p>“I have come to see you, Vane,” he told her quietly,
“because I have something to ask you.”</p>

<p>Vane felt her heart beat wildly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Stuart,” she said, faintly.</p>

<p>“Vane, you must know my inmost heart—you were my
confidante, my friend. I want you to continue to be my
friend, the best and truest of companions—I want a helpmate,
a counselor. I want you to be my wife.”</p>

<p>Vane stood silent, her head bent. She felt faint, and,
now that success had come at last, she could not speak.</p>

<p>“I cannot offer you great love,” Stuart went on, taking
her hand. “I will not deceive you, Vane—it is buried
in the past; but I will give you affection, devotion—true
and sincere devotion, if you will accept it. The gift is
poor, Vane. Reject it if you will.”</p>

<p>“Reject it, Stuart!” murmured Vane, turning her
luminous blue eyes on him. “No; I accept it, for I love
you—I have loved you through it all, and I am happy at
last!”</p>

<p>Stuart pressed his lips to hers; and the compact was
sealed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Miss Lawson kept to her word and departed on the
following day for Hurstley, despite all Margery’s pleading
and wishes. The short visit had been a great pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
to them both. To Margery the very sight of her
governess had brought back a wave of her brief past happiness,
and unconsciously soothed her; and Miss Lawson
had felt her heart thrill with pride and gladness to see
her pupil grown so fair and lovely a woman, and surrounded
by all that she could desire. Yet the strange
sadness in Margery’s eyes would haunt her. What could
be the secret that had destroyed her girlishness and
brought such an expression to the young face? Miss
Lawson pondered this deeply, but could arrive at no solution
of the mystery, and indeed would have been no
little astonished had she learned what link it was that
bound Margery’s heart to Hurstley. She knew the girl
had been acquainted with Stuart Crosbie; but that fact
was not strange, for Stuart had a kind word and smile
for every one in the village, and Margery, of course,
shared this general friendship with the rest.</p>

<p>Lord Court had welcomed Miss Lawson warmly and
courteously, and even in their brief meeting a mutual
liking sprung up between them. The earl was delighted
to see the flush of pleasure, called up by her presence, on
Margery’s face, and he added his entreaties to his wife’s
to urge the governess to stay longer; but their pleadings
were vain, and Margery could only kiss her true friend
and let her depart, having first extracted from her a
promise of an early visit to Court Manor.</p>

<p>The afternoon on which Miss Lawson left was gloomy
and wet, and Margery felt sad and a little lonely as she
sat with her books and work. Her husband had gone to
the club before luncheon, and she had decided to make
the best of a long afternoon when the door opened and
he appeared.</p>

<p>“Do you feel inclined to go out, my darling?” he asked,
tenderly, bending to imprint a kiss on her brow.</p>

<p>Margery looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Because,” he explained, “I should like to take you
with me to call on an old friend who is ill. I had no idea
he was in England. As a rule, he is wandering round
the world in a most extraordinary fashion. But I saw
Notteway at the club, and he told me Gerant has been
down with rheumatic fever for the last six weeks and
was quite alone. So I looked in on him for a few minutes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
and, having mentioned my young wife, he pressed
me to bring you around to see him, if you had nothing
better to do.”</p>

<p>“I will go with pleasure,” replied Margery, rising.
“Who is he, Nugent?”</p>

<p>“Sir Douglas Gerant. I knew him years ago in England;
but we met abroad principally, and I liked him
very much. He is a peculiar, almost uncouth, man, but
so kind and good—as tender as a woman and most unselfish.
For these weeks past he has been very ill; but
he would not let his people know, and has been attended
only by his servant, who has been his companion in all
his travels.”</p>

<p>“And he would really like to see me?” queried Lady
Court, putting her dainty work into its basket.</p>

<p>“He seemed to wish it. I happened to mention that
I was married; and, when I spoke of my happiness, he
said, in his old abrupt manner: ‘Bring her to see me,
Court, if she will not be frightened by such an old savage;’
so I came at once. But if you would rather not
go——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should like to see him!” broke in Margery.
“Poor man, all alone! And I have nothing to do this
afternoon. I will not be long, Nugent.”</p>

<p>With a tender smile the earl watched her graceful
figure flit through the doorway; then he walked to the
fireplace, and, leaning his back against it, gave himself
up to pleasant thoughts. The careworn look, the expression
of trouble and pain was gone from his face;
hope seemed written on every manly feature, and the
handsome, dark eyes flashed with a light of gladness that
spoke plainly of his altered life.</p>

<p>Margery was soon back. She had put on her sables,
a round cap of the same rich fur surmounting her red-gold
curls, and for once she wore no veil. She had
determined to hide herself no longer. She had nothing
to fear; it was she who had been wronged and insulted.
Pride lent her strength, and she felt that her
eyes could meet Vane’s clearly and coldly now, even
though her heart still ached with the pain Stuart Crosbie
had caused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>The earl settled her comfortably in the carriage, and
then stepped in himself.</p>

<p>“This weather is terrible,” he said, as they started.
“Once this law business is settled, Margery, I think I
shall take you to a warmer climate, to see the sunshine
and breathe the scent of flowers.”</p>

<p>“There is one pilgrimage I must make before we do
that,” returned Margery, in a low voice. “I cannot
rest till I have visited Enid’s grave.”</p>

<p>The earl raised her little black-gloved hand to his lips.</p>

<p>“You speak only of my heart’s thoughts, my own; but
I hesitated to take you to the manor in this wet, gloomy
weather. I thought the sunshine would——”</p>

<p>“Sunshine is beautiful; but the manor is home, and is
near her.”</p>

<p>Margery smiled faintly; she was compelled to speak
these words, for she felt almost overpowered by this
tender devotion, and suffered miserably as she thought
how poorly she could return it. Henceforth it mattered
little to her where she lived; but, if her choice of the
manor brought him pleasure, she was glad.</p>

<p>“Home!” repeated Lord Court, tenderly. “Ah, Margery,
you cannot know what a wealth of happiness there
is in that word! Thank you, dear, for uttering it. Yes,
we will go home.”</p>

<p>They were silent after this till they reached a quiet
street in an unfashionable quarter, and presently the earl
handed Margery into the doorway of a tall, gloomy-looking
house.</p>

<p>“Gerant always stays here,” he said, as they went upstairs.
“Will you remain here, my dearest, till I see if
he is ready to receive you?”</p>

<p>Margery smiled, and waited in a room that looked cozy
and picturesque in the fireglow. The walls were hung
with weapons of all nations; a heterogeneous mass of
quaint, curious things were grouped in corners; carved
and painted gourds were placed here and there, with
ivory ornaments and rare bits of china. It represented
a strange contrast to the dull, ordinary exterior of the
house, and Margery found much to attract her till her
husband returned.</p>

<p>“Now, my darling, come with me. Loose that heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
cloak, or you will be too warm; and, if the old man asks
you to sing, will you gratify him?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart.”</p>

<p>Lord Court led his wife across a passage, and pushed
open a door hung with curtains. The room that she entered
was almost dark, but Margery saw a low, flat
couch pulled near the fire, with a gray head resting on
the pillow. She could not see the invalid’s face properly,
but a faint something in the dark eyes struck her
as familiar.</p>

<p>“I have brought my wife to see you, as I promised,
Gerant,” said the earl, cheerfully, leading Margery to
the couch.</p>

<p>“It is kind of you to come, Lady Court,” the sick man
answered, in a faint, weak voice. “I have known your
husband a long, long time—years, eh, Court?”</p>

<p>Where had Margery heard that voice before? It
sounded familiar, faint and husky as it was.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to come,” she responded, simply, and
took the chair the servant pushed forward.</p>

<p>“And Margery will sing for you, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Margery!” whispered the sick man; and then he tried
to raise his head from the pillow. “Margery!” he repeated.</p>

<p>“I think Sir Douglas is ill,” said Margery, rather
frightened, turning to the servant.</p>

<p>“It is weakness, my lady,” returned the man.</p>

<p>“Let me raise him a little,” said the earl. “I think
he wants to speak.” In a lower tone he added to the
servant: “He’s much weaker than he was this morning;
what is it?”</p>

<p>“Spasms at the heart, my lord; his heart is very weak.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, my darling,” whispered the earl
to Margery. Then he put his arm round the sick man,
and raised him easily into a sitting posture.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas tried to murmur thanks, but for a few
seconds his weakness was too great. Then, as his
strength came back, he stretched out a thin, white hand
to the girl sitting in the shadow.</p>

<p>“Come into the light,” he whispered, “that I might
see your face.”</p>

<p>Margery slipped her hand into the speaker’s weak,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
trembling one, and bent toward him as the earl stirred
the fire into a blaze.</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes met the sick man’s hollow, dark ones,
which were full of strange eagerness and excitement, and
again she seemed to remember them.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas closed his long fingers over hers, and
drew her nearer and nearer, till she bent over him.</p>

<p>“Closer,” he murmured. “Yes—I—can see—it is!
Heaven is—good! You are——”</p>

<p>His strength seemed to fail entirely. Margery bent
still nearer as he sunk back upon the cushion, and her
heart-shaped locket escaped and dangled against his
withered hand.</p>

<p>“He is fainting!” she said, hurriedly. “Look how
pale he is!”</p>

<p>His eyes opened as he spoke, and wandered from her
face to the little gold locket. A spasm of pain caused
his mouth to twitch; his breath came in gasps; he tried
to open the locket, and his eyes spoke words that his
lips refused to utter. Then, as the earl drew Margery
back, the lids closed over them, and the face became
calm.</p>

<p>“It is only a faint. Come away, my darling! I wish
I had not brought you; but he was almost well this
morning.”</p>

<p>Margery suffered her husband to lead her into the
other room and place her in a chair. Her nerves were
unstrung, and she was full of vague, incomprehensible
excitement.</p>

<p>“Go back to him,” she murmured. “I am quite well.
I cannot leave till I know that he is better. Poor man!
How strange he looked!”</p>

<p>The earl obeyed her; and, when she was alone, Margery
put her hands over her eyes and tried to think what
the memory was the sick man had brought back to her.</p>

<p>“Is he better?” asked Lord Court, on his return to
Sir Douglas’ side. “It was only a faint, Murray?”</p>

<p>The man looked up from his prostrate master, and
shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“It is the end, I fear. May I make so bold as to
ask you, my lord, to ring that bell? I shall send to his
cousin immediately. Mr. Stuart should come at once.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
I hope her ladyship is not frightened? Sir Douglas always
seemed strange when he heard the name of Margery.”</p>

<p>“She is anxious to know how he is. I will take her
home, and return as soon as possible. Yes, send for
his relatives, Murray. The Crosbies, you say? Well,
they ought to come. Poor old Gerant!”</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly, my lord; I will. He will be glad
to see you, I know, if he recovers; but I never saw him
so bad as this before.”</p>

<p>The earl waited till he saw the heavy eyelids raised,
then he returned to Margery.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is better, darling,” he said, in answer to her
eager inquiry. “Come—I will take you home, and then
I will return to learn how he is progressing. Murray is
going to send to his people, the Crosbies, of Crosbie
Castle, and they will look after him.”</p>

<p>“The Crosbies, of Crosbie Castle!” The words rung
in Margery’s ears. In an instant she remembered where
she had met this man before. She saw once again the
hot, dusty lane, the lodgekeeper’s wife, the strange man
who had questioned her so curiously and spoken the
terrible words that blighted her young heart, and she
knew that Sir Douglas Gerant and that man were one
and the same. She stood silent, almost overcome
by the conflicting feelings within her breast, and was
scarcely conscious that the earl led her downstairs, and
she was driving home.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>


<p>That she possessed some strange magnetic influence
over Sir Douglas Gerant, Margery did not doubt, but
what it was she could not tell; it seemed so vague, so
mysterious, and yet her heart was filled with great and
unfathomable emotions. What had she in common with
Sir Douglas Gerant? Why should he gaze at her so
eagerly? She sat very quiet in her carriage, yet every
nerve was thrilling.</p>

<p>The earl noticed her manner, but attributed it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
sympathy she felt for the sick man. He regretted now
that he had taken her to see his old friend, but Sir Douglas
had seemed quite convalescent in the morning, and
he had thought the visit might do him good.</p>

<p>On reaching her room, Margery let her husband remove
her heavy mantle and her cap without a word;
then as he stood looking undecided beside her, she turned
to him.</p>

<p>“Please go back to him. I am all right, and I should
like to know how he is now.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you are better, darling? You were
quite frightened.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Go; perhaps you may be of some service.”</p>

<p>The earl stooped and kissed her, and was soon rattling
away in a hansom, while she sat silently thinking and
wondering over what had occurred.</p>

<p>Lord Court found Sir Douglas restored to consciousness,
but too weak to utter a word. Already there was
a great alteration in the worn face, and the sick man’s
eyes, as they wandered with a restless eagerness round
the room, struck the earl with sudden sadness.</p>

<p>“I’ve sent down to the castle,” said Murray, who was
watching his beloved master; “and I’ve also sent to Mr.
Stuart’s club. He may be in London; if so, he’ll come
as quickly as he can. I hope he is, for Sir Douglas
would like to see him, I know. Many and many a time
I’ve wanted to let Mr. Stuart know, but he wouldn’t
let me; he was always thinking he’d be better in a day
or two, and was longing to be off. He has fretted so
through his illness, my lord, it has quite worn him out.”</p>

<p>“Have you sent for the doctors?” asked the earl.</p>

<p>“They’ve just gone, my lord. They didn’t say much.
‘Give him a teaspoonful of brandy every half hour,’ they
said; and I know what that means, my lord.”</p>

<p>“How wasted he is,” thought the earl—“how changed!
I wish he could speak; he looks as if he wished to say
something.”</p>

<p>He bent and asked Sir Douglas if there was anything
he specially wanted; but the rigid lips did not move—only
the eyes seemed to plead more than before. The
earl’s presence appeared to give him pleasure, for, if
Lord Court moved, the thin, trembling hand went out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
toward him, and Murray construed this into a wish for
his friend to remain.</p>

<p>An hour passed without change, and the earl was
thinking of sending a message to Margery, explanatory
of his long absence, when the door opened, and the sick
man’s face suddenly altered. He made a feeble attempt
to rise, his hands moved restlessly to and fro, and his
lips parted to speak, as a young man bent over his couch.
It was Stuart Crosbie.</p>

<p>“Cousin,” he said, hurriedly, with real pain on his face
and in his voice, “my dear cousin, oh, why did you not
send for me before?” Then, turning to the servant, he
added: “Murray, you should have let me know! Six
weeks ill, and I thought him in Australia! It has distressed
me more than I can say.”</p>

<p>“Sir Douglas would not let me write, sir,” replied
Murray, as he put the brandy to the invalid’s lips. “Lord
Court came in to-day, and he’s the first person as has
been.”</p>

<p>“It was a shock to me, too, Mr. Crosbie,” remarked
the earl. “Gerant and I have been old friends for years.
I am heartily glad you have come.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said Stuart, putting out his hand;
“but cannot he have something to give him strength?”
Then, turning to the invalid, he added: “You want to
speak to me, cousin?”</p>

<p>He knelt down by the bedside as he spoke, and looked
eagerly into the sick man’s face.</p>

<p>“Sir Douglas has tried to speak, but he cannot, Mr.
Stuart—yet.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” interrupted Stuart, putting up his hand—the
pale lips were moving.</p>

<p>“You—will—not forget——”</p>

<p>“My promise?” finished Stuart, gently. “No; everything
you wish shall be done.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas fixed his eyes on Lord Court, and a faint
sound came from his lips. The earl bent his head the
better to hear.</p>

<p>“I cannot hear,” he murmured sadly to Stuart.</p>

<p>“Give me the brandy, Murray,” said Stuart. “Come,
that is right; we shall have you well and hearty soon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
cousin,” he added to the sick man. “Do not distress
yourself; I will do all I promised.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas looked at him earnestly, as if his dark eyes
would read his inmost heart. Then a change came over
his face, and he smiled faintly. His head was raised for
a minute from the pillow, and a whisper fell on their
anxious ears:</p>

<p>“Gladys—wife—it—has—come—to—Margery—little—Mar—gery—thank—Heaven!”</p>

<p>The voice died away, a convulsive tremor seized the
heavy eyelids, which closed slowly over the dark eyes,
glazed with a film now, the head sank back, and with a
sigh the spirit of Douglas Gerant fled from its earthly
abode.</p>

<p>Stuart knelt on, while hot tears were stealing down
his cheeks. A solemn trust was confided to his care—of
what nature he knew now. The ne’er-do-well, the
wandering nature, the truant from home, had not been
alone all his life. The name of “wife” passed from his
lips as death closed his eyes. Some tale of sadness, of
disappointment, was to come, and with it was linked a
name that had destroyed Stuart’s joy and youth—the
name of “Margery.”</p>

<p>A strange thrill ran through the young man’s frame
when at last he rose from his knees. There was now a
bond of sympathy stronger than had ever existed in life
between himself and his dead cousin.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“It is not true! I will not believe it! The whole
thing is a romance from beginning to end. Douglas
Gerant always——”</p>

<p>“Mother, do not forget you are speaking of a dead
man,” broke in Stuart Crosbie, quietly and sternly. “I
will not listen to such words.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie turned and faced her son. Stuart was
leaning against the mantelpiece in a room of a London
hotel, his face pale, yet determined. Mrs. Crosbie,
dressed in heavy black robes half-hidden with crape, was
walking to and fro, vexed and wrathful.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you will not dispute this iniquitous
will?” she asked, sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly not. I have no right. It is a most just
one.”</p>

<p>“And you will let Beecham Park pass from your
hands into the clutches of some low-born girl who has
no more right to it than a beggar in the street?”</p>

<p>“Except the right of a daughter.”</p>

<p>“Daughter!” repeated Mrs. Crosbie, with scorn.
“There was no marriage, and, even if such was the case,
the girl is not to be found; he lost trace of the mother
and child for sixteen years, and now has conjured up
some romance about a likeness in a village wench.”</p>

<p>“Mother, you are not just or temperate. Douglas
Gerant has set forth in this letter the sorrow of his
life. With his dying lips he claimed my promise to fulfill
his wishes, and I shall do so.”</p>

<p>“You are mad, Stuart!” declared his mother, coldly.
“But,” she added, with a sneer, “I need not look very
far for your motive; it is for the sake of this girl, this
Margery Daw, that you are determined to sacrifice everything.
Had Sir Douglas seen a resemblance in any other
woman, the desire to carry out his wishes might not
have been so strong. You have no pride, Stuart, not
a——”</p>

<p>“I have honor, mother,” Stuart interrupted, his brow
clouded, his face stern. “You wrong me and insult
me. The past is gone. Why bring it back? I shall do
my duty for Douglas Gerant’s sake, for honor, justice,
right and truth’s sake, and for nothing else. I shall
seek out Margery Daw; I have pledged myself to the
dead, and shall keep my word.”</p>

<p>“And what will Vane say to this quixotic course?”</p>

<p>“Vane is a true-hearted woman; she will say I am
right. But, should she not, then I cannot help it—I am
resolved.”</p>

<p>Stuart turned to the fire as he spoke, and looked into
the blaze with a pained, weary expression on his face.</p>

<p>“The world will call you mad,” observed Mrs. Crosbie,
crossing to the window and sinking into a chair, “and
Vane will be greatly displeased.”</p>

<p>“Vane loves me—so you say,” replied Stuart, quietly;
then he turned to the table, and began to write rapidly.</p>

<p>On the night after Sir Douglas Gerant’s death, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
seclusion of his room, Stuart had broken the covering of
the packet intrusted to his care, and read the contents.
The funeral was over now, and the will read. Beecham
Park was left to Stuart, with the proviso that he fulfilled
certain conditions contained in a letter already
placed in his hands.</p>

<p>The writing was close and crabbed, but it was distinct,
and Stuart read it easily.</p>

<p>“When I first decided upon making you my heir, Stuart,
I determined to couple that decision with another
that would perhaps prove as irksome to you as it has
been sorrowful and disappointing to me. But a new
influence has since come into my life—hope, sweet,
bright, glorious hope, with peace and gladness behind
it. Let me tell you my story.</p>

<p>“You will have heard of your cousin, Douglas Gerant,
as a scamp, a profligate, a disgrace. I was wild, perhaps
foolish and hot-headed; but, Stuart, I never dishonored
my name or my father’s memory. My brother
Eustace and I were never on good terms. He hated me
for my wild spirits, my good looks, and my success with
women, and I, on my side, had little sympathy with his
narrow, cramped life and niggardly ways; so one day
we agreed to part and never meet except when absolutely
necessary. I left him in his dull home at Beecham
Park, where his one idea of enjoyment was to scan
rigidly the accounts of the estate and curtail the expenses,
and went to London.</p>

<p>“From my mother I inherited a small income, which
proved about sufficient for my extravagances, and I
passed my days with a crowd of boon companions,
traveling when and whither I pleased, just as the mood
seized me. Among my acquaintances was one whom I
held dearer than all; we were bound together by the
firmest bond—true friendship. Conway was a handsome
fellow, with a reckless, dare-all style that suited my
wild nature, and an honest heart; we were inseparable.
And next to him in my friendship was a man called
Everest, a strong-willed being with a plain face, but having
the manners of a Crichton, together with a fund of
common sense. Everest was a barrier to Conway’s and
my wildness, and to him we owed many lucky escapes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
We were with one accord railers at matrimony, and a
very bad time of it any poor fellow had who deserted
our ranks to take unto himself a wife. I laughed and
bantered like the others, deeming myself invulnerable;
yet, when I laughed the loudest, I fell wounded. My
raillery was over, my whole nature changed. The
laughter and jokes of my comrades jarred on me; my
soul revolted from the lazy, useless life I was leading.
I grew earnest and grave—I had fallen in love. I had
seen a woman who suddenly changed the current of my
life.</p>

<p>“Gladys, my angel, my sweet star! She was the
niece of one of my mother’s old friends. I rarely visited
any of the old set, but one day the mood seized me to
pay a visit to a Lady Leverick, with whom as a boy I
used to be a great favorite; and at her house I saw my
darling. What need to tell you all that followed? I
haunted the house, unconscious that Lady Leverick grew
colder and colder, heedless of all but Gladys’ sweet face
and glorious eyes.</p>

<p>“At last the dream was dispelled; her aunt spoke to
me. Gladys was an orphan under her charge; she was
penniless, dependent on her charity, and she would not
have so wild, so dissolute a man propose for the girl’s
hand. I was mad, I think, for I answered angrily; but
in the midst of the storm came a gleam of golden light.
Gladys entered the room, and, in response to her aunt’s
commands to retire, put out her fair, white hands to me,
and, leaning her head on my breast, whispered that she
loved me, and that nothing would separate us.</p>

<p>“We were married. Lady Leverick refused to see, or
even receive a letter from my darling; and my brother
Eustace, in lieu of a wedding present, sent a curt note
informing me that I was a madman. A madman I was,
but my mania was full of joy. Could heaven be fuller
of bliss than was my life in those first three months?
My income was all we had, but Gladys had had little
luxury, and we laughed together over our poverty, resolutely
determining to be strictly economical. We took a
small house in St. John’s Wood, and then began my
first real experience of life. I sighed over the money I
had wasted, but Gladys never let me sigh twice, and always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
declared that she would manage everything. Out
of all my old friends, I invited only two to our home,
Guy Conway and Hugh Everest; but very happy little
reunions we had.</p>

<p>“We were quite alone, and though Gladys tried over
and over again to reinstate herself with her aunt, from
affectionate desire only, she failed. Lady Leverick
would not see her or own her, and my darling had only
me in the wide world.</p>

<p>“How happy I was then! Through Everest’s influence,
I obtained a secretaryship of a good club, and
the addition to our income was most welcome and helpful.</p>

<p>“The months slipped by with incredible swiftness and
sweetness till a year was gone and our baby born. All
this time Conway and Everest were our beloved and
most intimate friends, and Gladys seemed to like them
both. We christened the child Margery, but she was to
me no earthly being—her beauty and delicacy seemed
scarcely mortal. She was like her mother, and both
were marvels of loveliness, so much so that Conway,
who was a bit of an artist, insisted on painting them in
angel forms.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a storm gather in a summer sky
and in one moment darken the brightness of the sunshine
with gray, heavy clouds? Yes? Then you can
conceive how my life was changed by a swift, fell stroke
that almost crushed my manhood. I was much occupied
at the club, and was away from home many hours.
Sometimes it struck me, when I returned at night, that
my wife’s face was disturbed and sad, but the feeling
did not last, and as soon as we were together the expression
changed.</p>

<p>“One evening I was leaving the club, and, in passing
out of the door to enter the cab—I could afford that
luxury now—I felt myself touched on the arm, and,
turning, found myself face to face with Hugh Everest.
I welcomed him warmly, yet something in his manner
sent a chill to my heart.</p>

<p>“‘Dismiss your cab and walk a little way with me; I
want to speak to you,’ he said. I turned to the cabman
and did as my friend wished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“‘Now what is your important business, Everest?’</p>

<p>“‘Have you seen Conway to-day?’ he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>“‘Conway? Yes. He came to say good-by; he
starts for Monte Carlo to-night. Nothing wrong with
him, I hope?’</p>

<p>“‘Not with his health.’</p>

<p>“I turned and looked at Everest; he was deadly pale
and greatly agitated.</p>

<p>“‘If you have anything to tell me,’ I said, firmly, ‘do
so at once. I cannot stand suspense.’</p>

<p>“‘Then prepare for the worst. Conway has gone to
Monte Carlo alone, but he will be joined in Paris by a
woman to-morrow night. That woman is your wife.’</p>

<p>“My hand flew to his throat, but he was prepared, and
pushed me with almost superhuman strength against
some railings close by. We were at the corner of Pall
Mall, and, suddenly putting his arm through mine, he
dragged me toward the steps of St. James’ Park. Here
it was quiet. I loosened myself from his grasp.</p>

<p>“‘You are a coward and a villain!’ I exclaimed. ‘Your
words maddened me at first, but I am sane now. Great
heavens, that you should have dared to utter such a lie
and be alive!’</p>

<p>“He grasped my hand with his.</p>

<p>“‘Keep your head cool,’ he said. ‘If I had not proof,
do you think I should speak as I have done?’</p>

<p>“‘Proof!’</p>

<p>“I staggered to the steps and sank down, burying my
face in my hands.</p>

<p>“‘This afternoon,’ he went on, quickly, ‘I called at
your house. Your wife was in, the maid said, and I
entered the drawing-room. I waited several minutes,
and then the maid returned, saying that her mistress was
not at home, after all, and, leaving a message for her, I
took my departure. At the gate I picked up this note in
Conway’s hand; you can see it by the light of this lamp.
It says, “Come to my studio at once for final arrangements.
To-morrow I trust will see the end of all your
trouble, suspense and anxiety. Then will come my reward;
for you will trust in me henceforth forever, will
you not?” I was stunned when I read it,’ Everest went
on. ‘My first impulse was to tear it into shreds and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
cast it from me; but I thought of you, Douglas, and a
vague sense of danger stayed me. It was still early, and
I determined to go to Conway’s studio and reason with
him—demand an explanation. I went.’</p>

<p>“Everest’s voice grew husky for a moment, Stuart,
while every word he uttered went to my heart like a
knife; my youth died in that moment of supreme agony.</p>

<p>“‘I went,’ he continued, ‘and asked to see Conway;
he came to me for a second, looking strangely agitated.
I suggested staying with him till he started that evening,
but he refused to let me, and hurried me away. I took
my departure, ill at ease; for, despite his repeated asseverations
that he had much to do, I felt he had a visitor;
and my suspicions were only too well grounded, for, on
turning my head when I reached the road, I saw your
wife standing with him in the studio talking earnestly.
Then I came to you.’</p>

<p>“‘To crush my happiness!’ I exclaimed, recklessly. ‘It
was thoughtful!’</p>

<p>“‘You judge me as I feared,’ he answered, sadly.
‘Well, I have done what I considered my duty; the rest
is for you.’</p>

<p>“‘The rest will be forgotten,’ I answered.</p>

<p>“‘What—you will submit to dishonor, you will stand
deceit! You will receive her kisses to-night, remembering
her lover’s this afternoon! You are no longer a man,
Gerant!’</p>

<p>“His words fanned the flame of my jealous passion to
madness. Hitherto I had spoken mechanically, remembering
my wife’s purity and sweetness; but at his taunts
the blood in my veins became like fire. I wanted nothing
but revenge.</p>

<p>“Everest tried to calm me, but it was useless; he had
set the match to a train that would not be extinguished.</p>

<p>“The remainder of that night is like a hideous nightmare
to me. I can see myself now hurrying him from
the steps to the street and into a cab. I can remember
how sharp was the pain at my heart when I repeated the
vague, yet self-condemning words of Conway’s note. I
can see again the houses seeming to fly past us as we
dashed homeward. I can feel again the agony I endured
when, in answer to my hoarse inquiry, the maid said my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
wife was not at home. Again I can feel the agony of suspense,
rage, madness I suffered as I strode up and down
the road before the house, with Everest standing a little
way off, watching me with a calm, anxious face, till the
sound of light feet came to our ears, and I stood before
Gladys.</p>

<p>“I can see her pale, startled face, her shrinking form,
as in a suppressed voice I demanded to know where she
had been. She did not answer at once, and her hesitation
maddened me. I lost all manliness, Stuart. It
haunts me now—the misery of her face, the pleading of
her lips. But I would listen to nothing. In a flood of
passionate words I denounced her, thrust aside her hands
when they would have held me, and then, telling her we
should never meet again, I rushed away, leaving her
dumb and pallid as a figure of stone.</p>

<p>“Once I turned to go to her—a moment of remorse in
my madness—but Everest pushed me on, and so we
parted. Everest never left me all night; he took me to
his rooms, and sat watching me like a mother, with his
grave face and strange, earnest eyes. I was waiting only
for the morning; then I started for Paris—for Conway
and revenge!</p>

<p>“Gladys I would never see again. I left my money
and the settlement of my affairs in Everest’s hands in
case of my death, and he promised me to look after
Gladys; for, though I deemed her dishonored, I could not
let her starve. He was anxious to stay in England, but
I kept him beside me and refused to let him go.</p>

<p>“I crossed to Paris the next day, and sought everywhere
for Conway, but could not find him. Everest
grew impatient, but still I would not release him; and
two days passed without incident. On the third day I
learned that Conway had never left England, that he was
seized with sudden and severe illness at Dover; and,
when I reached that place he was dead.</p>

<p>“Robbed of my revenge, I sunk into gloomy despondency.
Everest went to London to look after my wife.
My body seemed paralyzed; I seemed no longer a man.
My friend was away a week, and then returned suddenly
and told me, with a strange, pale face, that Gladys was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
gone—had disappeared with her child, and could not be
found.</p>

<p>“My misery was so great, I scarcely realized the horror
of this. My brain was dulled by intense pain. As in a
dream I listened to him, hardly heeding him, and conscious
only of a vague relief as he left me to go abroad,
to shake off, he said, the anxiety he had suffered.</p>

<p>“I stayed on another week or so at Dover, still in the
same condition. Then my brain suddenly cleared; but
my misery returned in greater force. I was mad once
more with an agony of pain. I left Dover; it was hateful
to me. I traveled to London. A longing, a craving
seized me to see Gladys, to look on her once more,
though she was dead to me forever. I drove to the
house; and the memory of Everest’s words came back to
me then—that she was gone. Pale and faint with anxiety,
I alighted at the well-known gate, and I saw at a
glance that the house was deserted.</p>

<p>“What had become of Gladys? How had she managed?
Was she starving—lost in London, with not a
friend in the world? In an instant my rage was
quenched. I saw her only in her sweetness, her beauty,
and I leaned against the gate, overwhelmed with the
flood of miserable thoughts that crowded upon me.</p>

<p>“But it was not a time for dreams. I felt I must act.
So I hurried to the house-agents, feeling sure that they
could tell me something. From them I gleaned the barest
information. My wife had visited them early in the
morning following that dreadful night, paid them the
rent to the end of the quarter, and left the key. I questioned
them closely and eagerly, but could gather nothing
more, and then I went away, feeling like a man
whose life was almost ended. Over and over again I
whispered to myself, with a twinge of remorse, that
Gladys was innocent, and would have explained all if I
had only let her. Then the memory of Everest’s words,
the damning evidence of Conway’s note, returned, and I
knew not what to think; but on one point I was certain—henceforth
life held no duty for me till Gladys was
found. Though the golden dream of our joy was ended,
though I doubted her, she must be found and cared for.</p>

<p>“I began a search—a search, Stuart, that has lasted all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
my life. By good hap at this time a distant cousin, dying,
bequeathed me his property, which, though not large,
came like a godsend at the moment, for every available
penny I had, had been expended in my search. I was
haunted by my wife’s pale, horror-stricken face gleaming
in the moonlight, by the memory of my baby child, whose
prattle had sounded like music in my ears. I knew too
well the miseries, the horrors, of London, and I could not
bear to think that the woman I had held so near and—Heaven
help me!—still treasured in my heart, was
thrown into its terrible jaws and left to perish without a
helping hand.</p>

<p>“I pray Heaven, Stuart, you may never know the
darkness of those days, the unspeakable anguish, the
depth of despair! Weeks passed. I could find no trace,
and when I was tortured with the conflicting emotions
which surged within me an event occurred that put the
last stroke to my misery, added the ghastly weight of a
wrong to my burden, a wrong which I could never wipe
away.</p>

<p>“I had resigned my post at the club, and, in my eager
restlessness, wandering about the London streets, either
alone or with one of my detectives, I was lost even to the
remembrance of the frequenters of my old haunts. One
day, however, I met a man who had been very friendly
with me, and in the course of conversation—I would
gladly have avoided him if I could—he told me there
were several letters awaiting me at the club. None knew
where to send them.</p>

<p>“I went for the letters, urged by a wild hope that
Gladys might have written. She had. It was a letter
that is graven on my heart in characters of blood.
Heaven give me strength to tell you; for even now, after
so many years, I grow faint when I think of it! It was
a long, hurriedly-written letter—the letter of a distraught
woman. I will not give it to you here; there were no
reproaches, but there was a clear statement of facts given
by a broken heart. In my anxiety I could scarcely read
the first lines, but some words further on caught my
eyes, and held them as by magnetic power. They spoke,
Stuart, of the persecution she had endured for weeks
from Hugh Everest. Again and again, Gladys wrote,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
she felt urged to speak to me, but she knew I valued
him as a friend, and she trusted that his honor, his manliness,
would overcome his baser feelings, and that he
would go away. Of Guy Conway she spoke tenderly
and earnestly. The letter I had brought forward as a
proof of their guilt was indeed written by him; but it
referred to a painting he was engaged upon of herself
and her child, which she had intended leaving at her
aunt’s house, hoping that the sight of the baby’s angel-face
would break down the icy barrier which caused her
such pain. This had been a little plan of his, suggested
when he saw how the estrangement troubled her. She
was at Conway’s studio, but only for the purpose of discussing
the delivery of the picture; and, catching sight
of Hugh Everest, in a moment of agitation and dislike
she openly expressed a wish not to see him. Conway at
once undertook to prevent their meeting, with what terrible
result you know. My wife ended her letter by stating
that she was gone from my life forever with her child.
The shock of my suspicions had destroyed all joy or
happiness evermore for her; but, though separated, she
would live as became my wife and the mother of my
child, for whose sake alone she could now endure life.
This ended it; there was no sign, no clew, no word to
lead me to her.</p>

<p>“I was not a man, Stuart, when I had read that letter;
I was a brute—a savage animal. Had Hugh Everest
been near me, I should have torn his cruel heart from
his body, and his tongue from his false, lying lips. A
fury seized me to find him—find him, though I searched
the world round; face to face with him, I could breathe
out the passion, remorse, revenge, scorn, and agony of
my bursting heart. But I could not leave England till
I knew where my darling was, my sweet, wronged angel—till
I had knelt in the dust at her feet, and bowed my
head in shame; and so my search went on.</p>

<p>“Years passed, but only a slight clew turned up now
and then, always with the same ending. I have wandered—led
by these disheartening clews—from one country to
another; and at last the men I employed grew weary,
and I had to work alone. But I was kept alive by my
love and my desire for revenge. Everest never came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
England—coward and villain—but the day came, a day
not long past, when we met, and on his dying bed I
forced him to confess his wrong and own his deceit.
Then, when he was gone, the misery of my wasted life
returned, and I sunk for a while beneath my load of care.</p>

<p>“Hope was almost dead forever when I visited you at
Crosbie; and then suddenly by one of those strange, unexpected
chances that come to us at times, it burst into
a living, glowing flame once more. All through the past
years I had prayed that, should Gladys be gone, my
child might be spared; and, Stuart, my prayer was
granted. At Crosbie one morning I came face to face
with a girl at sight of whom I seemed to have stepped
back into the past. I was startled by the image of my
sweet wife. I spoke to the girl, learned her name—Margery
Daw—and not until she had gone did hope
wake in my breast, bringing once more the feeling of
eager gladness that I thought dead forever.</p>

<p>“I waited a day or two, but quietly made inquiries, and
obtained all the information I wanted; then, having first
tested the truth and honesty of your nature, I determined
to confide all to you, and claim my child; for that
she is my child there is no doubt. But happiness was not
to be grasped at once; again fate was unkind. When I
made my way to the cottage where Margery lived, it
was to find her gone—gone across the sea to Australia.
The sudden pain and disappointment aside, I was myself
again. Australia was nothing to me; I would start at
once, and clasp my child yet in my arms before I died.</p>

<p>“So, Stuart, I leave this in your hands. If I succumb,
seek out my Margery and give her her rights. To you I
leave all, for I know you will do as I wish; and remember
she is your cousin and your equal. Guard her,
Stuart, from harm, if it be in your power, and may
Heaven bless and reward you for all you may do! It
will be necessary to explain how I discovered Margery
to be my child. As I told you, I made most minute inquiries,
learning all particulars from people both in Chesterham
and Hurstley. I sought for Dr. Scott, the medical
man who had attended during the railway accident;
he had left Chesterham many years before, but he remembered
the incident well, and his description of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
poor dead woman only confirmed my hopes and fears.
Acting upon his advice, I went to Newton, and by dint
of money and able men traced my darling’s life during
two long years of misery. The story of her sufferings,
of her daily toil, her heart-broken life, I cannot dwell on.
Heaven grant you may never know the terrible agony of
hopeless remorse and longing that I am now enduring!
Despair seizes me when I remember my madness, her
wrong—my angel-wife! Even the joy of finding my
child cannot bring me peace. The happiness I experience
in the knowledge of her existence is tinged with
never-dying bitterness and sorrow, for she recalls her
mother.</p>

<p>“But I weary you with my moans, Stuart; let me get
on with my story. Gladys then, without a friend in the
world—for her aunt would have nothing to say to her,
being especially bitter when she learned we were separated—doubted
and wronged, had, in addition to her
other troubles, the hardship of poverty to face. She
struggled to get employment, with little success however;
from time to time she managed to make money by
teaching, but this never for long. Still, through all her
trials, her courage never forsook her; she lived for her
child. I have spoken with some who knew her in those
days; they dwelt on her sadness, her sweetness, her innate
refinement, little knowing how their words rent my
heart. It would be useless to describe the hopelessness,
the misery of her life; she parted with all her jewelry,
and at last in desperation answered an advertisement for
a situation as maid.</p>

<p>“Beyond this I cannot write positively, but my heart
tells me the truth. The situation that Gladys had obtained
meant separation from her child. She had heard
me speak of my cousins, the Crosbies; and I am convinced
she was on her way to seek protection from your
mother and shelter for the baby before taking up her
new duties, when death claimed her and ended her sorrows.</p>

<p>“I inclose with this letter the certificates of our marriage
and of Margery’s birth. My lawyers have in their
possession a small box, which after my death they will
hand to you. It contains the jewelry that belonged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
my wife. Give it to Margery. And now, Stuart, I have
finished. Pray befriend and guard my child as far as lies
in your power. My heart is full of gratitude when I
think of the good, kind women who took her, a weak,
helpless babe, and tended her so well. I have written to
Lady Coningham words of gratitude that sound empty
compared with the feelings that prompt them; would
that I could have done so to the others—Mrs. Graham
and Mary Morris! But death has garnered them, and
the power is taken from me. One thing more, Stuart—lay
me beside Gladys in the little country churchyard
where kind, strange hands laid her; though in life we
were separated so ruthlessly, let us in death be together.”</p>

<p>Stuart had sat long after he had read the letter, his
heart aching with pity for his dead cousin. The tale of
sorrow was so heavy that for a time it banished his own
grief; but, as he rose and paced the room, the memory of
his duty brought all back clearly, and he saw the bitterness
of the task before him. A faint wave of gladness for
her sake was checked by the reflection that they were
parted forever. Still he would be firm; he was pledged
to the dead; and, even were the pain deadly, he would
keep his word, seek out Margery, and give her her
rights as his cousin, and heiress to Beecham Park.</p>

<p>The news that caused Mrs. Crosbie such wrath and
annoyance brought alarm and fear unspeakable to Vane
Charteris’ breast. This unexpected blow following on
her unexpected success almost crushed her by its suddenness.
Stuart would meet Margery, learn the truth,
and she would be humiliated and disgraced. Moved by
her anxiety, she added her voice to his mother’s, and
endeavored to shake his determination to sail for Australia.
She did not betray herself by word or look; she
only spoke prettily of her loneliness, and of how it would
be a wiser course to send out an agent to the antipodes
in search of his new cousin, and not to go himself. She
stored her speech with references to Margery’s faithlessness,
hoping they would take effect; but it was all to no
purpose. Stuart was firm, and refused to be turned from
his determination. Had his father added his voice to the
others, he might have yielded; but the squire was eager
that Stuart should fulfill his promise, and declared truthfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
that his health was so much stronger that his son
might leave him without any hesitation. So, instead of
the clear sky which Vane had pictured to herself, clouds
were gathering on all sides, and fear planted thorns at
every step in her path, making her faint with apprehension
and dread of exposure and disgrace.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>


<p>Margery was strangely affected when she learned that
Sir Douglas Gerant was dead. She could not banish
from her mind the thought that in some way her presence
had caused him distress. The earl saw her pained
face, and immediately determined to put all business affairs
aside and take his wife down to Court Manor. So,
on the afternoon following her visit to the late baronet,
Margery was carried away from London to her new
home.</p>

<p>When she arrived it was too dark for her to see her
surroundings; but the pure freshness of the country air,
the silence after the bustle and noise of the London
streets, the faint soughing of the wind in the trees,
brought a thrill of peace and gladness to her, and as she
stood at the low, wide door and gazed around the quaint,
rambling hall she looked so pleased and comforted that
the earl’s heart rejoiced. It was a delightful old-world
place. The corners and crevices, the rooms filled with
serviceable furniture of no modern date, the smell of the
flowers, the glow of the firelight—all seemed to speak
of home. It was a haven of rest and quiet after the
storm of the past few months. And if at night this feeling
came, it was even stronger in the morning. As she
drew her curtains aside and looked out over the wide
vista of country, Margery gave a little sigh of relief.
Here she had nothing to fear, nothing to remind her of
the past; here it would be easy to forget and grow content.</p>

<p>The pain that contracted Nugent’s heart as he stood
once more in his old home ceased when he saw the glow
of hope, love, and happiness on his wife’s delicate, lovely
face, and he pictured to himself a future all brightness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
and gladness. In both their hearts, as they entered the
house, the same memory lived—the memory of Lady
Enid. Margery sent up a little prayer to Heaven that
she might prove grateful to the man whose heart was
so tender and true, whose sufferings had been so great,
and he mutely thanked his angel-sister that ere she went
she bequeathed so great a treasure to him as Margery.</p>

<p>His whole being was so impregnated with his great
love that he had failed to discover the true cause of
Margery’s passive gentleness. It was true he did not
think her heart held so deep a love as his own; but she
was young, the marriage was hurried, love must have
time to grow. In time his great devotion must reap
its reward. The liking she now had would change to
love. He must be patient and wait. So he reasoned in
his happiness, dwelling with a thrill of joy on the memory
that Margery had neither relatives nor friends. This
girl, the star of his life, had none but him to tend her,
none but him to whom she could turn. The pleasure
that Margery showed in her new home struck the final
chord of happiness in his heart.</p>

<p>The girl found much to occupy her in her new position,
and her lovely face and kind words soon won the servants’
hearts, already disposed to love her for her gracious
influence over their master.</p>

<p>It was about the end of the week that Margery learned
accidentally from her husband that he had neglected
his business in town on purpose to bring her away,
and, without a moment’s hesitation, she begged him to
return and complete his arrangements. The earl demurred,
but at last, satisfied that she would not be lonely,
he agreed, and departed, leaving many tender injunctions
with her to take great care of herself in his absence.</p>

<p>The young wife felt a pang of remorse at the relief
and pleasure she experienced when quite alone. She
struggled hard with herself day and night; but to forget
was so hard, and to remember so easy. Though she
was surrounded by all that the world holds dear, she
found no satisfaction in her wealth; her mind was lost
to the present—it would persistently wander to the past—that
past which, despite its pain and humiliation, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
so sweet. The return to the country had brought back
so much that was linked with her brief love-dream that
the struggle seemed to grow greater day by day.</p>

<p>Pauline noticed her mistress’ grave, sad face, but attributed
it to his lordship’s absence, and, to cheer her,
would repeat the servants’ tales and anecdotes of his
goodness, little thinking that every word went to Margery’s
heart like a sword thrust. She regretted with a
deep, unspeakable grief, that she had been silent with
Lady Enid; had she but spoken of Stuart and of her unhappiness,
all would have been different, and she would
not have pledged her vows to this man, the depth of
whose generosity, tenderness, and devotion touched her
with acute pain. If she could but give him in return
one-half the love he bestowed on her, she would be happier;
but her love was dead, buried in a past summer
dream, and she had nothing left for him.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, that was all that remained now, “a broken blossom,
a ruined rhyme.” Her life might be sweet again,
but it would never be as it was on that evening in Weald
Wood, when her young heart was first touched by love.</p>

<p>Lord Court was absent two days; then he suddenly
announced his intended return. Margery was wandering
in the gardens and the pleasance when Pauline brought
the telegram to her. With a vague sense of apprehension,
Margery tore it open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Your master returns to-night, and brings a guest.
Tell Mrs. Perry to see that the rooms are prepared,
Pauline.”</p>

<p>Pauline nodded her head in a self-satisfied manner.</p>

<p>“I am glad. Milord will be welcome; it is so gloomy
here for miladi alone. Ah, and miladi will make a grand
toilet to-night?”</p>

<p>“I leave myself in your hands, Pauline,” returned
Lady Court, with a faint smile, which vanished when she
was left alone.</p>

<p>Her husband was returning again! Once more she
would suffer the agony of pain and remorse in his presence;
but she must be strong, and remember only her
duty and how much she owed him.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore away, and evening was drawing
on. It was dark and gloomy, one of those unpleasant
days that come in November. Margery walked to and
fro, till she was wearied, and then turned into a small
room that she had chosen for her boudoir. She gave
the order for the carriage to be sent to meet the earl,
and sunk down before the fire, resting her head on a low
velvet chair. She wore a heavy mourning-robe, simple
yet costly, and her delicate face and throat gleamed with
so dark a setting. She was altered from the Margery
of the summer, yet her face was only a child’s face. Her
youth, the purity of her countenance, her deep sapphire
eyes, her curly silken masses of red-gold curls, were the
admiration of Pauline. She brought her mistress some
tea, served in fragile Sèvres china, and then stood for an
instant and looked down on the face that was so fair
in the fireglow.</p>

<p>“Miladi is tired,” she said, sympathetically; “she walks
so much.”</p>

<p>“I am a little weary,” Margery answered, waking from
her thoughts; “but that is ended now, I hope.”</p>

<p>She spoke to herself more than to the maid; her mind
was on the one subject that had engrossed her all the
afternoon. Pauline smiled; she thought she understood
the meaning of her words.</p>

<p>“Ah, milord is to return!” she decided, and went away
to her room.</p>

<p>Margery sat on before the fire. The tea had revived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
her, yet she seemed strangely agitated as the time drew
near for her husband’s arrival. A vague sense of approaching
trouble had come over her, and she put her
hand to her heart to try to stay its quick, hurried beat.
She had been thinking so deeply that her nerves were
unstrung. The solitude had tried her, she told herself;
yet, even as she whispered this, her heart began to flutter
again. It was a strange, incomprehensible feeling, a feeling
she had never experienced before, and she longed
for, yet dreaded, her husband’s return.</p>

<p>At last the sound of wheels caught her ear, and she
rose from her seat.</p>

<p>“I will be firm—I must forget!” she whispered. “My
love, good-by, good-by!”</p>

<p>Then she heard the sound of voices in the hall and
knew that her husband was close at hand. She turned
to greet him as the door opened, and in the dim light
she saw two men enter.</p>

<p>“Margery, my wife!” said Nugent’s grave, tender
voice; and his lips touched hers.</p>

<p>His companion not coming forward, the earl still holding
Margery’s hand, looked around.</p>

<p>“I have brought a friend home, darling. It is only
a flying visit, as he is off to Australia; but I persuaded
him to come for a few days. There will be a bond of
friendship between you through poor Gerant. Crosbie,
let me introduce you to the Countess of Court.”</p>

<p>The stranger moved forward mechanically into the
light. Margery’s hand grasped her husband’s. She
raised her eyes, and, with a sudden agony of pain, saw
her lover, Stuart, before her.</p>

<p>She tried to offer her hand, but the effect was too much.
A mist dimmed her vision, her brain reeled, and she fell
to the ground, pale and unconscious, at her husband’s
feet.</p>

<p>Pauline rushed in as the bell rang loudly. She pushed
aside the earl as, in terror and alarm, he knelt beside
his wife, never noticing that Stuart Crosbie stood silent
in the center of the room, his hand grasping a chair.</p>

<p>“It is nothing!” cried the maid, raising Margery’s
beautiful head. “Miladi will walk, and bring the fatigue.
Miladi has been <i>désolée</i> in milord’s absence and now it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
is the joy. See, she recovers, milord! Leave me with
her alone. She will be well.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>


<p>At midnight, while the clouds were driven across the
moon by the wind, Stuart Crosbie sat in his chamber at
Court Manor, his arms folded, his head bent dejectedly
upon his breast. He was stunned by the strange events
of the past day. He could never tell how he had borne
himself through the long evening, though every incident
was graven on his heart forever. He could not grasp
the meaning of what had taken place. He met the earl
at his club, having a little time to spare before the vessel
sailed, and he accepted Lord Court’s invitation with a
vague feeling that he should escape the reproaches, mute
and open, which otherwise he must hear in town. The
earl had taken a sudden liking to the young man, and
some rumor reaching his ears as to Stuart’s proposed
voyage to Australia, he begged the nephew of his old
friend to honor him with a short visit before his departure.
So Stuart had assented, hardly heeding whither he
went, his mind occupied with the task before him to find
his cousin Margery; and in the twilight, with the firelight
revealing her loveliness, he had, with a shock that
stunned him, come suddenly face to face with the girl he
sought, the girl he loved.</p>

<p>It was so strange, so incomprehensible. A feeling of
acute pain came to him. At the sight of Margery his
love rose up again in all its vigor, full of bitterness and
despair, however, for she was a wife. He sat on in the
chill night hours, his brain full of disturbing thought.
The mystery, the suddenness of the whole thing, seemed
to stun him, to crush his very being. During the whole
evening he had sat listening to his host’s voice, and answering
in monosyllables. Margery did not appear; of
that he was only too distinctly conscious. The rest was a
blank. And now he was alone, bewildered, tormented by
pain, despair, love. His journey was ended before it had
commenced, for he had found Sir Douglas Gerant’s
daughter, found the owner of Beecham Park. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
morning he must unfold his tale, and then—go from her
forever.</p>

<p>He rose and, approaching the window, opened it. How
came Margery hither? he asked himself. What strange
fate had brought him to her at that very moment? What
story would he hear on the morrow? Had he wronged—doubted
his love? A cold shudder seized him at the very
thought. With an effort he put it from him. What
could Margery say in self-defense? She had deceived—cruelly
deceived him. Whatever the cause, he could not
forget that. What explanation would she give him?
Perhaps none; and he had no right to demand any. The
difficulties of the situation seemed to become greater and
greater as he pondered it in his mind. He moved from
the window, and walked slowly up and down the room.
Margery, the girl he had loved, trusted, revered, the girl
he was about to seek in a far-distant clime, was under the
same roof with him at that very instant, the wife of his
host, the Earl of Court. It was inexplicable. His mind
could find no solution to the problem; he could but wait
for morning light.</p>

<p>Stuart was not the only one who was awake and disturbed
that night. Margery, clad in a silk dressing-gown
as white as her cheeks, was pacing the floor of her
chamber. She had pleaded illness, and begged to be left
with Pauline; and, once alone, she sent her maid into the
dressing-room and fought the battle with herself in solitude.
If sorrow, despair, anguish, had come to her before,
they visited her now with redoubled force. It
seemed to her the very irony of fate, a mockery of her
good intentions, that she should be so tried at such a
moment—a moment when she had thought herself a conqueror
over her weakness. Of what avail had been her
struggles, her earnest prayers, her resolutions? The
sight of Stuart’s grave, handsome face, the intoxication
of his presence, had left her weak; the memory of his insults,
his deceit, had banished everything but the knowledge
that she loved him still. She longed for the weary
night to pass, yet dreaded the coming of morning, when
she must meet him, speak to him, when his every word
would be as a dagger thrust into her heart.</p>

<p>Dawn was creeping over the sky when, thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
wearied and ill, she flung herself upon her bed. As she
lay, her eyes fell on the sapphire ring that she wore, and
the memory of Enid—her patience, her suffering, her
courage—stole into her heart. Then her mind wandered
to her husband, and to all his great goodness; and, remembering
this, she sent up a fervid prayer for strength
to do her duty to this man; and, as the sighing plea left
her heart, she grew comforted.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Stuart left his room early, and, despite the cold,
gloomy morning, made his way into the grounds to think
and nerve himself for the coming ordeal. He looked pale
and wan; his eyes had never closed all night, his restless
thoughts had never left him. His task was ended, he
told himself—his cousin was found. He must just state
the truth, and then go away from her fair, false sweetness
back to the long, straight path of duty, back to the
woman who had loved him so long and so well, back to
his pledged word and the burden of life.</p>

<p>He was walking to and fro beneath the leafless trees,
his heart almost as dead and withered as the leaves beneath
his feet, when a cheery voice hailed him, and, turning,
he saw the earl.</p>

<p>“You are out early, Crosbie,” cried Lord Court, as he
approached. “I saw you from my windows.” Then, in
a tone of surprise, he added: “But you look ill. Is anything
the matter?”</p>

<p>“I did not sleep well,” returned Stuart, hurriedly, “for
I have had a shock. I am going to tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>“A shock!” repeated the earl, with a smile. “Don’t say
the manor is haunted. I believe it is most unorthodox
not to have a family ghost, but I have never heard yet
that we have one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“It is not a ghost—it is a reality! I meant to have
spoken to you last night, but I was so surprised that I
could hardly realize the truth of what I saw. I will explain
now.”</p>

<p>“Come indoors,” said Lord Court, looking a little bewildered.
“It is sultry out here. Now, Crosbie,
I am all attention—begin,” as they entered the house.</p>

<p>“You are aware I was about to start for Australia next
week. Do you know why?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the earl. “And, to tell you the candid
truth, I was just a little puzzled as to the cause of your
hasty departure.”</p>

<p>“It was to fulfill a wish of my dead cousin, Douglas
Gerant. He left a daughter; it was in search of her I
was to sail on Thursday next.”</p>

<p>“A daughter! Why, I never knew Gerant was married!”</p>

<p>“It was a secret,” said Stuart; “but I have the whole
history in a letter which he confided to my care. Now
comes the strange part of the story. This daughter was
thought to be in Australia, was even traced to that part
of the world, when suddenly, as I am about to start to
find her, by one of those extraordinary turns of fate, I
come face to face with the cousin I seek—here—in your
house!”</p>

<p>Lord Court stood still and looked at Stuart earnestly.</p>

<p>“In my house!” he echoed, slowly, as if doubting his
ears. “Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Your wife.”</p>

<p>“My wife? Margery? You are jesting!”</p>

<p>“Jesting!” repeated Stuart, grimly. “I was never so
serious in all my life! Sir Douglas Gerant’s lost
daughter bore the name of Margery Daw. She was
placed in a home in Hurstley—my native village. Evidence
was forthcoming that she had gone to Australia
with Reuben Morris, the husband of the woman she had
called mother. I knew her well; and last night, when
I came face to face with her, I was overwhelmed by
the discovery that Margery Daw and the Countess of
Court were one and the same person.”</p>

<p>Lord Court passed his hand across his brow.</p>

<p>“I cannot think clearly yet,” he said, slowly; “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
news is rather sudden.” He paused for a little. “There
is no mistake—you are sure?”</p>

<p>“I am sure,” answered Stuart, emphatically.</p>

<p>The earl was silent for a minute, then his face cleared
and brightened. He put out his hand to Stuart, who
grasped it silently.</p>

<p>“I can think and speak now. My darling has found
her rights, and she is your cousin. The feeling of
friendship for you which came so strongly to me, Crosbie,
has now a solid basis beneath it. How happy she
will be! And yet it is sad, at one and the same moment,
almost, to find a father and to lose him. Fate
must have led her to his bedside on that day. Thank
Heaven, he saw her once before he died! Come—let us
go in and tell her. Words seem so feeble to-day that I
cannot express half of what I feel. The mystery of her
birth has hung over my darling like a dark cloud; and
now, by Heaven’s mercy, it is gone, and she will be free
and happy.”</p>

<p>They turned and walked in silence along the hall.
Pauline was tripping down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Miladi is in the south room—she would attend the
<i>déjeuner</i>,” the girl said; and the earl walked quickly
down a long corridor to a door hung with heavy curtains.</p>

<p>“We will tell her now,” he whispered; and in another
moment they were in the room.</p>

<p>Stuart’s vision was obscured for the first few seconds,
then it cleared, and he saw a slender, graceful girl, with
fair, pale cheeks and a wreath of red-gold curls, before
him. She had her hand clasped in the earl’s; and, as
his senses returned, Stuart saw her deep-blue eyes grow
dark with surprise, and her face become whiter than the
folds of the heavy serge gown that draped her.</p>

<p>In a soft, low voice, tender and passionate, the earl
told her all; and Margery stood beside him, hearing
nothing save the words:</p>

<p>“Sir Douglas Gerant’s daughter, the cousin of Crosbie,
my friend.”</p>

<p>Stuart drew back while the earl murmured soothing
words in her ear, and she gradually awoke to the reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“He was my father,” she said, dreamily; then, with
a sudden rush of remembrance: “Ah, now I understand
all!” She sank into a chair and buried her face
in her hands. Presently she rose, saying to the earl:
“Tell me everything.”</p>

<p>Lord Court put his lips to her hand.</p>

<p>“Crosbie will do that, my darling; he is your cousin
now, you must remember. Give him your hand, and bid
him welcome to your home as your kinsman and your
friend; you were too ill last night to do so.”</p>

<p>Margery’s heart seemed to stand still; then, nerving
herself for the effort, she stretched out her hand.</p>

<p>“You are welcome, cousin,” she said, in a faint voice.</p>

<p>Their fingers met for an instant, then dropped apart;
and Margery turned away, feeling that the agony of this
meeting was almost greater than she could bear.</p>

<p>The earl drew her gently toward him. She was too
weak to offer any resistance—was even glad of the support;
and, standing with her husband’s arm around her,
Margery heard the story of her father’s sorrow and her
mother’s martyrdom slowly but distinctly from Stuart
Crosbie’s lips. The words went home to her heart; the
despair, the misery caused her unspeakable pain, and
tears rained from her eyes.</p>

<p>The earl, wrapped up in his thoughts for his wife, took
no notice of Stuart’s agitation and pallor. He did not
think it strange that the young squire of Crosbie Castle
should have been so surprised at seeing Margery. His
sister had told him the girl’s history, as she had heard it
from Miss Lawson, and, remembering that his wife had
been called a village girl, it was not likely her action
would be known at the castle. He only felt a great wave
of gratitude and happiness fill his heart. The mystery
of her birth solved, Margery would now be content, and
there would be no barrier to their complete happiness.</p>

<p>As Stuart spoke of Beecham Park, Margery raised
her head.</p>

<p>“The estate is mine?” she said, slowly.</p>

<p>“You are the next heir,” answered Stuart.</p>

<p>“Therefore you are a great lady,” put in Lord Court,
smiling. “Beecham Park is one of the finest places in
England. But come, Crosbie; sit down. This has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
a morning of surprises, but we must eat, or we shall sink
beneath them altogether. You must pay us a long visit
now, for you have no reason to go—has he, Margery?
When there was Australia to consider, it was another
thing.”</p>

<p>So the earl chatted on, eager to rouse Margery from
the dreams into which she had fallen; and with a glance
at Stuart, he adroitly turned the conversation and plunged
into other topics.</p>

<p>Margery sat silent. She could not eat—her brain was
in a whirl; and at last she could bear her distress no
longer, and with a murmured apology she went slowly to
the door.</p>

<p>“Yes, rest, my darling,” said Lord Court, as he followed
her; “this news has been too much for you. But,
before you go, tell your cousin that if he departs, it will
be at the risk of your grave displeasure.”</p>

<p>Stuart had risen, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>“You will stay,” she said, faintly; and then the door
closed, and she was gone.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Should he go or stay? was the burning question in
Stuart’s mind all that morning. Duty and honor bade
him tear himself away; yet there was something mysterious
and altogether apart from the inthrallment of Margery’s
presence that kept him. He spent the long hours
walking about the grounds with the earl, forcing himself
to discuss the all-important subject of Margery’s birth the
while he was growing faint and weary with the struggle
that raged within him.</p>

<p>The surprise, the sleepless night, the agitation at last
began to tell; and, as the afternoon advanced, Stuart was
obliged to confess that he was quite exhausted and could
walk no farther.</p>

<p>The earl was full of contrition for his thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>“Come back to the house. Would you prefer to go to
your own room? If not, rest in my ‘den.’ I can answer
for its silence and coziness.”</p>

<p>Stuart preferred the “den;” the mystery of the previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
night haunted him—he hated the thought of his luxurious
bedroom. The earl led the way to the north wing
of the house, and, going to the extreme end of a corridor,
pushed open the door of an apartment that seemed to
warrant his statement. It was three-cornered and quaint,
and at the end branched off into another room, which led
through a long French window to the grounds. Lord
Court closed the door between the two rooms, and, pushing
a chair to the fire, made his guest comfortable, handing
him at the same time the batch of newspapers that
had just arrived from London.</p>

<p>“Now you are settled,” he said, genially. “You look
as if sleep would not come amiss; and, such being the
case, I shall have no hesitation in leaving you. I must
drive to Beverley Town, a good distance away; I have
an important interview on hand with a troublesome tenant.
I shall be back, however, before dinner. Are you
sure you won’t be bored?”</p>

<p>Stuart replied in the negative, and, after seeing him
cozily ensconced, Lord Court quitted the room, and made
his way to the stables.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Stuart leaned back wearily, and gave
way to thought. Once again the struggle raged between
duty and desire. The love that he had thought was treasured
only for his ideal lived for the woman who had deceived
him, and swept away all memory of that other girl
who, through all her trouble and sorrow, had soothed
and helped him. There was everything to call him away,
yet he felt he could not go until he had gazed once more
on the delicate beauty that had seemed to him the personification
of truth and sweetness in the summer that was
gone. There was something altogether strange and incomprehensible
in Margery’s marriage. The earl had
casually mentioned the love that his dead sister had had
for his wife, and Stuart would have followed up the remark
in order to learn how it was that the village girl
had became the Countess of Court; but the earl would
talk of nothing but Sir Douglas Gerant and the wonderful
discovery of his daughter.</p>

<p>Stuart took up his paper and forced himself to read;
but the words seemed to run into each other, and his
mind refused to be diverted from the mystery and perplexity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
that tormented it. As he lay back, wearily gazing
into the glowing coals, he saw his duty clearly—he must
leave the manor and put every barrier between Margery
and himself. Vane had been true, faithful, devoted; to
her he would return, and by earnestness and determination
try to thrust out all remembrance of his false love
from his heart, and forget that she even existed.</p>

<p>The struggle was ended now, he told himself; his path
was clear and well defined. A sense of peace stole over
him, the firelight flickered amid the fast-growing shadows.
Stuart’s head drooped, his eyes closed, and his
troubled spirit was soothed in slumber.</p>

<p>The afternoon grew into winter dusk; the fire had settled
in a glowing mass of red embers, and not a sound
disturbed the silence. Presently the door was opened
gently, a white hand pushed aside the curtain, and Margery
stood in the room. As her eyes fell on Stuart’s
motionless form, her heart gave one great leap, then sunk
again; she let her gaze rest with unspeakable sadness and
tenderness on her lost lover’s face, then she turned to go.
She moved away softly, and her hand was on the door,
when a sound came from behind:</p>

<p>“Margery!”</p>

<p>She turned at once, to see Stuart with his hand outstretched.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she faltered, faintly. “I did not know
you were here. I came to find my husband. I have disturbed
you.”</p>

<p>Stuart’s hand fell, and he bowed his head to the arm of
the chair.</p>

<p>“You are ill!” Margery went on, quickly. “Let
me——”</p>

<p>Stuart raised his head and rose to his feet, steadying
himself with one hand on the chair.</p>

<p>“I was dreaming,” he answered, hurriedly; “but I am
awake now, Lady Court.”</p>

<p>The color faded from Margery’s face.</p>

<p>“Your husband has gone to Beverley Town,” Stuart
continued, in a voice that sounded strange in his own
ears. “He settled me comfortably in his own ‘den’ before
starting, and told me that he would be home to
dinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>Margery bowed her head and turned toward the door,
when Stuart moved forward as if to arrest her.</p>

<p>“As I shall leave you this evening,” he said, hurriedly,
“I will take the present opportunity of informing you
that the letter and proofs I spoke of this morning shall
be sent to you as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” responded Margery, as calmly
as possible. “Thank you for all you have done.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Margery felt as if some strong,
unknown power held her to the spot. She wished to
move away, yet could not; and Stuart let his eyes rest
on her fair loveliness, feeling that his resolution to depart
was growing weaker and weaker as he gazed.</p>

<p>“I have done nothing,” he said, almost harshly, trying
to hide his agitation.</p>

<p>“It is all so new and strange,” murmured the girl, putting
one hand to her throat and speaking as if to herself.
“How often we have discussed the story of my mother,
yet how far we were from the truth! And we were
cousins all the time.”</p>

<p>“What use is there in recalling the past?” asked the
young man, hoarsely. “It can bring nothing but pain.”</p>

<p>Margery looked up at his pale, drawn face.</p>

<p>“Pain?” she repeated, slowly. “I wonder if you know
what pain I have suffered!”</p>

<p>She spoke unconsciously, urged by the memory of all
her sorrow, her girlish despair and her humiliation.</p>

<p>“What should give you pain?” cried Stuart, harshly,
folding his arms in his agitation. “You have riches,
title; you can do as you will; you are Lady Court.”</p>

<p>The bitterness of his voice went to her very heart.</p>

<p>“How cruel you are!” she murmured, her head dropping
upon her breast.</p>

<p>“Cruel?” he repeated, moving to her side, mad with
the intoxication of his love and the remembrance of her
deceit. “Were you not cruel when you coquetted with
me, led me on, lied to me, and then deceived me?”</p>

<p>“Deceived you! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Stuart met her clear, blue eyes, startled, yet strangely
steadfast.</p>

<p>“Why do you say such wicked, such cruel things of
me?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>Stuart hesitated for a moment. A sudden strange fear
crept into his heart.</p>

<p>“You may give them other names,” he said, huskily;
“I call it deceit, I call it wickedness to act as you did—to
laugh at me, to send false, tender messages the while you
were fooling another man, and suddenly to leave the village
for him, forgetting me and all the words you had
spoken only three days before.”</p>

<p>Margery had moved slowly to the table. She still
wore the long robe of white serge that she had donned
in the morning. She looked up at Stuart, mystified and
pained by his words. She put one hand on the table
and gazed at her old lover, whose arms were still folded
across his breast.</p>

<p>“I do not understand,” she said, distinctly yet faintly.
“You accuse me of deceit.”</p>

<p>“Let me recall the past,” returned Stuart, letting his
hands drop to his sides, while he moved nearer to her.
“On the day we plighted our troth, the words I spoke,
Margery, were from my heart, not lightly meant or
lightly given, but solemn and serious; while yours——”</p>

<p>“While mine,” she cried, raising her head proudly,
“live as truly in my heart now as they did on that day!
Ah, what have I said?”</p>

<p>She moved to a chair, and, flinging herself into it,
buried her face in her hands, while he stood as he
was, hardly realizing what it was that caused the sudden
glow within his breast, the unspeakable happiness
that possessed him. In a moment, however, Margery
rose; pride had come to her aid. She looked at him
steadily, her two small hands clasped.</p>

<p>“You have accused me of deceit,” she said, “spoken
words insulting to a true woman; but it is what I should
have expected from the man who trampled on a girl’s
heart, her life, as you did on mine. Ah, how wrongly
I judged you! I thought you a hero, a king; you
proved yourself mean, dishonorable, despicable!”</p>

<p>She drew a quick breath, then went on, not noticing
that his face had grown as pale as her own.</p>

<p>“I was only a village girl, a plaything of the hour,
sufficient to amuse you when you were dull, a toy to be
tossed aside when I had given you all the amusement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
you wanted. It was nothing to you what might come to
me—I served your purpose. In my foolish ignorance
I gave you all my heart; I let you see how deeply I
loved you; and, in return, you went back to your
cousin, your equal, and laughed at my foolish weakness
as a good joke. You to talk of deceit, of lies—you, who
offered me such insults, sending me money through her—money,
Stuart, when my heart was breaking!”</p>

<p>She paused, her hands pressed close to her heart,
which beat most painfully. Stuart moved nearer to her;
he put one hand on her arm.</p>

<p>“Insults—money!” he echoed, in a hard, quiet voice
between his clinched teeth. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“What do I mean? I mean the humiliation you offered
me when you sent that cruel, beautiful woman, your
cousin, to me, with cold, insulting words and an offer
of money as a cure for all I might suffer!”</p>

<p>Stuart’s hold tightened on her arm.</p>

<p>“Vane offered you insults—money!” he said, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Margery. Then, as he turned away
with a groan, she added, hurriedly: “You did not send
her, Stuart?”</p>

<p>“Send her? Great Heavens! you ask me that?”</p>

<p>The girl drew back, frightened by the agony in his
voice, and he moved to the fireplace, leaning one arm on
it for support, with his face turned from her.</p>

<p>“Tell me what happened,” he said, after a brief pause.</p>

<p>Margery drew a quick breath, and then, in a low, sad
voice, she spoke of her sorrow at Mary Morris’ death,
her trouble because of his accident, her meeting with
Sir Douglas Gerant, and the words he had spoken. Then
she told him of Robert Bright’s proposal, and of the
sorrow and agony of Vane’s visit, the result of which was
that she determined to leave the village at once, and to
that end sought the help of Miss Lawson. A few sad
words told of Enid’s death and her marriage.</p>

<p>Stuart never moved during the recital; his heart
seemed turned to stone. He dared not think of his love—the
misery of his loss maddened him; it was of the
treachery and cruelty he thought; and his brain whirled
at the memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“And you believed that of me?” he asked, almost mechanically.</p>

<p>“It seemed so true,” murmured the girl, wistfully;
then, pressing her hands together, she whispered: “And
it was not?”</p>

<p>“It was false from beginning to end!”</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and a shudder passed over each. Margery
felt her heart grow cold as ice, a lump rise in her
throat.</p>

<p>“We were deceived,” she said, faintly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me—oh, forgive me!” she cried. “How I
have wronged you!”</p>

<p>Stuart clasped her hand with his own, then dropped
upon his knees at her feet, and pressed his lips to her
fingers.</p>

<p>“Forgive you!” he said, passionately. “It is from you
forgiveness must come, my sweet, my love! I shall
kneel at your feet till you have pardoned me, Margery,
my darling!”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!” she whispered. “Forgive you? Yes, a
hundred times! Indeed, it is all forgotten now, forgotten
and done with.”</p>

<p>“Forgotten!” cried Stuart. “Ah, no!”</p>

<p>“We were brave in words on that day, Stuart,” said
Margery, gazing at the fire. “How little we guessed
that the battle would begin that very moment, the fight
be so long! We were so happy, and now——”</p>

<p>“And now,” he said, hoarsely, rising to his feet, “life
is ended forever! You are not free. I find you and
lose you forever at the same time. What have we done
that fate should be so hard, so cruel!”</p>

<p>Margery felt the gladness, the triumphant joy, die out
of her heart, her senses grow numb and heavy; she came
back from the happy past to the present; she remembered
all.</p>

<p>“Stuart,” she said, slowly and impressively, “it is too
late to speak of that; we must part now, never to meet
again.”</p>

<p>“Never to meet again!” he repeated, raising his head
from his hands. “Oh, no, no—that is too much! Let
me see you, hear you speak. If you are taken from me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
now, the darkness will be too terrible. Ah, Margery,
have some pity! Think of our love, our dream; do not
send me from you.” He seized her hands in his, and half
drew her into his arms; but, as his eyes fell on her pale,
troubled face, he loosed his hold, and, standing upright
before her, said, rapidly: “Yes, I will go—I will go to
the uttermost parts of the earth—to death—if only you
will tell me that you love me, have ever loved me, and
me only!”</p>

<p>Margery buried her face in her hands. She was silent
for a few seconds, and then she looked up.</p>

<p>“I am a wife, Stuart,” she replied, slowly drawing her
breath as if in pain; “at the side of a deathbed I took
upon me the most solemn and sacred vows. My husband
is good; the depths of his nobility and generosity
you could never fathom. To speak such words would
be dishonorable, would be a sin. I can say no more.”</p>

<p>Stuart’s head fell forward on his breast; the soft, sad
tones touched his manliness to the core.</p>

<p>“Forgive me!” he said, huskily. “You are right—we
must part; I will leave Court Manor as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“It will be best.”</p>

<p>The words fell almost coldly from her lips; her eyes
were closed in pain, her face was pale and drawn. She
paused an instant, then moved slowly from the fire, from
the proximity of the man bowed down by his despair.
She seemed almost overwhelmed by the magnitude of
this new sorrow; but, though she looked so frail and
delicate, she possessed unusual courage. Her pride and
honor supported her in this worst of all her troubles.

<p>And brave the struggle she would, though it broke her

<p>At the door she turned. The sight of Stuart’s grief
struck her painfully; she held out her hand, urged by
an uncontrollable impulse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“Stuart!” she said, faintly.</p>

<p>He was beside her in an instant.</p>

<p>“If you value what I say,” she whispered, as he clasped
her hand, “you will be brave. Do not speak of your
life as ended. We both have duties. We have been
tried; but Heaven has been very good, for the clouds of
doubt and suspicion that hung over our hearts have been
dispelled. To know the truth is happiness and comfort—let
us be grateful and not murmur. Now, good-by.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and he bent his head till his lips
touched her small, cold, trembling hand.</p>

<p>“I will remember, cousin,” he responded; “good-by.”</p>

<p>The curtain was moved aside, then fell back again to
its place, and Stuart Crosbie was alone.</p>

<p>Stuart stood by the fire alone, heedless that the embers
were slowly dying, heedless of the dusk that filled
the room, heedless of all save his burden of misery. He
was too weak to grapple with his sorrow—too prostrate,
from the freshness and poignancy of his grief, to overcome
it. At last he roused himself; he had to act, not
think. He raised his head, looked round in a dazed,
troubled way, and, with a weary step, went slowly from
the room.</p>

<p>As the sound of his footsteps died away, the door of
the inner room was opened and a man approached the
fire—a man from whose face all joy and happiness had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
fled, in whose dark eyes a world of speechless agony
glowed, round whose mouth dwelt the desolation of
hopelessness. He stood erect for an instant, then, with a
deep groan, buried his face in his hands and sunk into
a chair.</p>

<p>It was Margery’s husband—Nugent, Earl of Court.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Blustering March had come round, and gossip had
worn to a thread the story of Lady Court’s romantic
birth. It had seized on the history of Sir Douglas
Gerant’s long-lost daughter with avidity, for it was not
often that society’s jaded appetite was regaled with so
delightful a morsel. Many things had happened since
dull November, but foremost among them were two
events—Lord and Lady Court were abroad, to the great
annoyance of society, as it was thus debarred from beholding
her ladyship in person, and the engagement between
Stuart Crosbie, heir to Crosbie Castle, and Miss
Vane Charteris, his cousin, came to an abrupt and
strange termination just as the congratulations were
pouring in. Many reasons were given in strict confidence
for this unsatisfactory affair. It was averred that
Miss Charteris had quarreled with her aunt, Mrs. Crosbie,
and that Stuart, like a dutiful son, had espoused his
mother’s cause; that cold, beautiful Vane refused to become
her cousin’s wife when she discovered that Beecham
Park had passed away from him; and that Miss Charteris
had grown tired of her affianced husband. These
and numerous other explanations were whispered; but
no one knew the truth—none but three people—the
cousins themselves and the mistress of Crosbie Castle.</p>

<p>Stuart had not reproached his mother; but his mental
suffering caused her much uneasiness and genuine
shame. She never knew what took place between Vane
Charteris and her son, for Stuart was silent, and her
niece left town with her mother for Cannes immediately
after the rupture. She felt that Vane must be suffering
disappointment, but she could never guess the humiliation,
the sullen revenge and anger that were gnawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
at her niece’s heart. Go where she would, at every turn
Vane had Stuart’s contemptuous face before her, heard
his bitter words, saw herself again as he had shown her,
in her true light, dishonorable and despicable. That the
marriage should have been broken off was acute disappointment;
but the odium she had brought on herself in
his eyes was even harder to bear. The malicious spite
she had felt toward Margery deepened now into actual
hatred; it galled her to desperation to know that the village
girl should have become so great a person, her equal
in birth, her superior by marriage. Poor Lady Charteris
was overwhelmed with sorrow at the abrupt termination
of her daughter’s engagement, and fretted herself to a
shadow because of Vane’s irritability and peevishness.
She lavished all her heart’s tenderness on her daughter,
hoping and trusting to see her regain her spirits; but it
was weary work. Vane, crushed by her own deceit and
wrong-doing, was rapidly changing into an envious,
soured, miserable woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosbie was ignorant of the whole of Vane’s
cruel falsehoods and insults; and, knowing this, Stuart
accepted as truly genuine her proud words of sorrow and
vexation for her share in the matter. It had been a
startling disclosure to Mrs. Crosbie when she found that
Margery Daw had become the Countess of Court; but,
when surprise had died away, she felt unconsciously
gratified that her new relative should hold so high a
social position, and was even disposed to be friendly
toward her, although she had deprived Stuart of
Beecham Park. She wrote a courteous note to the
young wife when her excitement had cooled, welcoming
her as her kinswoman, and offering her warm congratulations.</p>

<p>Margery was in Rome when this letter reached her.
She read it through slowly, then, with a faint smile,
folded it and put it away. It was not in keeping with
her generous nature to bear malice, so she replied to
Mrs. Crosbie’s epistle with a few words of acknowledgment
written in a kindly spirit. Margery received another
letter at about the same time which brought a
flush of sincere pleasure to her face. It was written by
Miss Lawson in the name of the villagers of Hurstley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
offering Lady Court warm expressions of affection, respect
and esteem from all her old friends, and at the head
of the list of names were the signatures of Farmer Bright
and his wife; Miss Lawson’s own letter explained everything.
Just after the news of Margery’s parentage was
made public to the village, a letter came from Robert
Bright in Australia, from which his mother gathered how
unjustly she had wronged Margery in her hasty suspicions;
and, eager to make atonement, the good woman
had headed the village letter with her name. Robert
spoke of returning almost immediately, so Margery’s
heart was lighter on that score. Miss Lawson’s words
of joy at her dear child’s prosperity and happiness
brought tears to Margery’s eyes; but they were tears of
gratitude and affection, not of pain.</p>

<p>She was strangely peaceful and content now; the memory
of Stuart’s supposed deception and insults, which
had rankled so long in her breast, was gone; she remembered
only that his love for her had never faltered. Her
girlhood was buried in her short love-dream; she was a
woman now, brave and determined to fight the battle of
life gallantly to the end. She looked to her husband as
a guide and a comforter and he tended her with more
than a husband’s care. A great, true affection had
sprung up in her heart for him; he was so tender, so
good, so manly! In her gratitude for all his thought
and care she vowed always to keep a smile for him
while the secret of her love should be locked from his
sight forever. Sometimes she would sink into a reverie,
then wake, to find his eyes fixed on her with such intensity,
such an agony of love and pain in them, that
it would startle her; but as she looked the expression
would fade and the smile would come, the tender, grave
smile that she knew so well. When Mrs. Crosbie’s second
letter came, begging the earl and countess to pay
her a visit, it was he who replied; and, as if divining her
secret thoughts, he wrote that his wife regretted she
was unable to visit Crosbie Castle at present.</p>

<p>They had left the manor almost immediately after
Stuart’s departure. Lord Court suggested a short tour of
the Continent and Margery eagerly agreed; so they
crossed the Channel without delay. But, as the winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
slipped away, it occurred to Margery that she should
visit her inheritance, Beecham Park. So, bidding farewell
to the clear blue skies and the world of delights that
had been opened to her, they returned to England.</p>

<p>Beecham Park was a huge, gloomy mansion, so deserted
and solitary-looking that, as they drove up the
magnificent avenue of chestnuts, Margery involuntarily
shuddered. Sir Eustace Gerant had neglected the estate,
and, splendid though the building was within, it
did not bring the pleasure to its owner that Court Manor
had.</p>

<p>“Are you disappointed, my darling?” asked the earl
one morning, after watching her carefully.</p>

<p>“It is very grand; the grounds and woods are beautiful;
but it is not home,” she answered, with a sigh.</p>

<p>However, there was much to be done—for they found
that the steward, who had had sole control of the estate,
had neglected his duties most disgracefully; so, placing
all authority in the hands of her husband, Margery
turned her attention to the village near, burying all regrets
and vain hopes that assailed her in untiring work
on behalf of her tenants.</p>

<p>It was a weary trial at times, for, though she had courage,
her strength would occasionally fail, and her heart
would yearn for the love she had lost; but none knew of
this struggle but herself—she had learned to control her
emotions and smile when the burden was heaviest.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of Stuart she heard nothing; but she had faith in his
courage and manliness, and knew that, once the cloud
which overshadowed him had passed, he would fulfill his
word and face the world. He was once more her ideal,
her hero, and she felt he would not fail in this duty to
himself.</p>

<p>Engrossed in her thoughts and daily tasks, she did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
notice the change that seemed to be coming over the
earl. His tenderness never failed, his courtesy and love
were never lacking, and she had grown so used to all his
thoughtful care that it seemed but the adjunct of everyday
life. But she was suddenly awakened from this existence.</p>

<p>The Squire of Crosbie Castle had been one of the first
among her new relatives warmly to welcome Margery.
He had loved her father, and for his old affection’s sake
had opened his heart to the young girl; when therefore
he learned that the Earl and Countess of Court had returned
to England and were staying at Beecham Park,
he wrote immediately, expressing a great wish to visit
them. To this Margery and her husband replied with
genuine pleasure, begging the squire to come as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>Margery found a warm love spring up in her breast for
Stuart’s father, and the earl and the squire soon became
good friends. It was the squire who called Margery’s
attention to Lord Court’s quiet manner and worn appearance,
as they were talking together one morning.
Margery listened with a sense of regret and remorse at
her blindness, and, making some excuse, she left the
squire in the grounds where they had been sauntering
and hurried back to the house. It was a glorious spring
day; the sunshine illuminated the old mansion, darting
in golden shafts through the long, narrow windows.
Margery crossed the hall, above which was seen a massive
dome and round which ran the gallery leading to the
upper apartments and bedrooms. Several servants were
hurrying to and fro; and, asking for the earl, she learned
that he was in the study, busy with the new steward.</p>

<p>Without hesitation she made her way to the room and
opened the door. The earl was alone, leaning his head
upon his hand, reading some papers which lay on the
table.</p>

<p>“This lease is wrong, Robins,” he said, not looking up
as the door opened.</p>

<p>Margery moved forward softly, and then knelt at his
feet.</p>

<p>“Nugent!” she said, with a little catch in her breath as
she noted his pale, worn face for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>The earl turned with a smile so sweet and tender that
it made Margery’s lips tremble.</p>

<p>“My darling!” he exclaimed, gently. “You here?”</p>

<p>“Nugent, you are ill—worried! Ah, I have been blind
not to see it before! Oh, forgive me, forgive me!”</p>

<p>Lord Court raised her head tenderly.</p>

<p>“Why, Margery,” he said, lightly, “what is the matter?
Who has been frightening you?”</p>

<p>“I am nervous about you; you look so worn and ill.
Nugent, you must put away those deeds and writings.
They distress me.”</p>

<p>“You shall not be distressed then, my darling; see—I
have put them away at once. But you are mistaken,
Margery; I am not ill, only a little tired.”</p>

<p>“Tired?” she repeated, putting her hands on his.
“Yes, yes, of course! How forgetful I am! I leave you
all this tiresome business to do. I am very selfish.”</p>

<p>“You are my dear, sweet Margery!” he said, lightly.
“But what has caused you this sudden fear, my darling?”</p>

<p>“You have been looking ill for so long! The squire
has just spoken to me, and it has frightened me; and,
Nugent, I want to ask you something. Will you promise
to do it?”</p>

<p>“What can I refuse you, Margery?”</p>

<p>“Then let us leave here and go back to the manor—the
squire is longing to see our dear old home. You will
come, dear?”</p>

<p>“Home!” repeated the earl, dreamily, as if the word
brought content. Then, with a sudden contraction of his
brows, as if from pain, he added, “But it will be lonely
for you, my dear one; you will not care for it.”</p>

<p>“I wish it with all my heart,” said Margery, quietly,
glad to see that this proposal brought a gleam of pleasure
to his eyes.</p>

<p>“Then,” returned her husband, looking with a strange,
sad steadfastness into her glorious eyes—“then we will
go home, Margery.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>


<p>Back at Court Manor, Margery banished for a while
the sad memory of her lost love. This spot was hallowed
by the presence of Enid’s spirit, and for that reason,
apart from all others, was dear to her. The squire
reveled in the picturesque surroundings of the estate.</p>

<p>“They may call Beecham magnificent,” he said, dreamily,
as he stood in the old-fashioned gardens and gazed
round on the fragrant flowers, “but this is home.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Sholto, you indorse my opinion. I love the
manor!”</p>

<p>Margery, clad in a long robe of creamy white, with just
a knot of black ribbons at her neck and in her broad-brimmed
hat, glanced at her husband as she spoke, and
smiled at him.</p>

<p>The squire responded to his hostess by a poetical quotation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“‘And primroses, pale gems of spring,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Lay on the green turf glistening</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Close by the violet, whose breath</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Is so sweet, in a dewy wreath.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And, oh, that myrtle—how green it grew,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With flowers as white as the pearls of dew</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That shone beside! And the glorious rose</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Lay like a beauty in warm repose,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Blushing in slumber.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Margery listened dreamily. Her thoughts had flown
to the springtime of her life, recalled by the breath of
the flowers, the sweetness of the air.</p>

<p>The earl had wandered across the lawn; and, though
he looked less grave and worn, the expression of his eyes
as he turned from Margery was unspeakably sad.</p>

<p>Margery’s reverie was disturbed by the squire, and she
was soon deep in an interesting scientific discussion with
him. Presently her husband returned, followed by one
of the gardeners.</p>

<p>“I am going to the west part of the grounds, my darling,”
he said. “Marshall tells me the men are going to
cut down that dead tree this morning. It was struck by
lightning in the autumn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“I will come with you, Court,” broke in the squire.
“In my young days I was rather good at that sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>“Come, by all means. Marshall, see that there are two
extra axes ready.”</p>

<p>“You are not going to help them, are you, Nugent?”
Margery asked, quickly and nervously.</p>

<p>“Yes, my darling. But don’t be afraid; I am, as
schoolboys would say, a ‘big gun’ at wood-cutting—am
I not, Marshall?”</p>

<p>“Indeed you are, my lord,” the gardener replied, solemnly.</p>

<p>“May I come and watch you?”</p>

<p>The earl hesitated.</p>

<p>“I should be afraid, darling, as the splinters fly about
so rapidly; but perhaps I can place you in a safe corner.
Run and put on some stronger shoes; the ground is
damp down at that corner. You have good ropes, Marshall?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p>“I will follow you directly,” said Margery; then, as
they turned, urged by an uncontrollable impulse, she
called, “Nugent!”</p>

<p>The earl came back at once.</p>

<p>“You are sure there is no danger?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure—as certain as any man can be.”</p>

<p>Margery smiled, raised her lips to his, and he kissed
her. A faint flush rose to his brow at the simple action;
and then, with a swift, tender look, he turned and walked
rapidly away.</p>

<p>Margery went quickly to the house and changed her
shoes for a stronger pair; then, seeing the look of eagerness
on Pauline’s face, she good-naturedly told the maid
to put on a hat, and they started together.</p>

<p>The sound of voices and of heavy blows led them to
the exact spot, and Pauline, in her excitement, could not
repress little shrieks and exclamations of astonishment.
As they turned the corner the earl came toward them;
he had removed his coat, and, with his strong right hand
grasping the ax, his face flushed from the unwonted exercise,
he looked almost handsome.</p>

<p>“Come here, my darling,” he said, leading Margery to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
a safe nook. “Crosbie, stand by my wife. We shall soon
have it down, poor old tree! How well I remember it in
my schoolboy days! You are frightened, Margery!”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, with a smile, though her heart
thrilled with strange apprehension.</p>

<p>The squire came to her, looking rather despondent.</p>

<p>“I find that years have greatly lessened my strength,”
he remarked, with a little sigh, “and I must look on
now.”</p>

<p>Margery did not answer; she was watching her husband.
She heard his clear, ringing voice directing the
men, saw his straight even strokes, and the excitement
overcame her dread. It was a novel scene, and one that
pleased her, though the sight of the gray dead trunk, the
remains of a noble flourishing tree, saddened her somewhat.
Pauline cowered and shrieked as she heard the
great, rough mass creak; but Margery never moved; the
bustle and vigor of the men roused her spirit—she almost
longed to assist. The earl, glancing now and then
at the group of watchers, caught the gleam of her eyes,
and, smiling, he waved his hand toward the girlish figure
that looked so fair and graceful in its white robes against
the background of young trees and bushes.</p>

<p>“It was not such a tough job as it looked,” observed
the squire, as he watched the men throw stout ropes
round the great trunk and knot them firmly, preparatory
to dragging the tree to earth.</p>

<p>Margery nodded her head absently; she was lost in the
excitement of the moment. She saw the earl wave them
further back toward the bushes, felt Pauline draw her on
one side, though her eyes never left her husband’s form,
and then came a moment of silence. Suddenly a mighty
crash sounded in her ears, while a cloud of dust obscured
her vision.</p>

<p>“Is it all over?” she asked, vaguely, turning to the
squire; but her cousin had left her side and was hurrying
to the group of men.</p>

<p>“Miladi will return?” queried Pauline, with a little
shudder. “Ah, what terrible noise!”</p>

<p>“I will wait for Lord Court,” answered Margery; then,
after a little pause: “But, Pauline, what is the matter?
Some one is hurt!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“They crowd together—that is all, miladi. Shall I go
and see?”</p>

<p>“No; I will.”</p>

<p>Drawing her skirts together, Margery left her retreat
and approached the group. As the men looked round
and perceived her, she thought they seemed alarmed and
pained. She quickened her steps, and then the squire
came toward her.</p>

<p>“You must let me take you to the house, my dear,” he
said hurriedly; “your husband wishes it.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter? Some one is hurt! Cousin
Sholto, don’t stop me! I know now—it is Nugent!”</p>

<p>She pushed the squire’s trembling hand to one side,
and with swift steps approached the group. The men
fell back in silence, and in an instant she was on her
knees beside a silent, prostrate form with face of deathly
hue.</p>

<p>“Nugent!” she cried, bending over him, in agony.
Then, as he still lay perfectly still, she looked round
wildly. “What is it? Fetch a doctor quickly—your master
is hurt!”</p>

<p>The man Marshall stepped forward.</p>

<p>“We’ve sent for the doctor, my lady. It was done in
an instant; the tree swerved and brought his lordship
down with it. We’ve just dragged it off his body. He
were sensible at first, and asked us to keep you away;
but he’s fainted now.”</p>

<p>Margery scarcely heard the explanation; with a heart
full of dread she was bending over the pale face, breathing
words of agony and tenderness that fell on silent ears.
The squire came to her and tried to draw her away; but
she would not stir. They brought brandy from the
house, and a mattress with pillows on which to carry the
injured man; but all were afraid to touch him. Then,
when her misery, her despair, was greatest, the heavy
lids were raised, and she met the gaze of the deep, dark
eyes. The white lips trembled and moved; she bent her
head to catch the whisper.</p>

<p>“It—is—nothing—my darling. Take me to——”</p>

<p>The labored speech died away in another faint; and, as
she saw his weakness and suffering, Margery rose to her
feet with courage born of despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“Carry your master to the house,” she said, steadily,
never taking her eyes from his face.</p>

<p>The men stooped, and, with tender, gentle hands lifted
the inanimate form on to the mattress; then, with slow,
even steps, they carried him through the sunlit gardens
to the house. It was not far, yet by the time they reached
the entrance the doctor of the village was seen riding furiously
up the avenue. He leaped from his horse, and was
at the wounded man’s side in an instant. Margery turned
her eyes from the pale face of her husband and fixed them
upon the doctor. As he scanned the earl’s drawn countenance,
her heart seemed to stand still. In that moment
she was conscious of nothing but an agony of dread, remorse
and pain so terrible that it almost overpowered her.</p>

<p>“Carry him into a room on the ground floor,” said the
doctor, decisively. “We must not risk the stairs.”</p>

<p>They carried him through the hall into the room where
long before he had sat by Enid’s couch. Margery walked
with them, though what power enabled her to move she
knew not, for all life seemed dead within her.</p>

<p>The men withdrew quietly to the doorway, while she
crouched down by the still form and buried her face in her
hands. The squire and the doctor exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“Get her away!” murmured the latter. But Margery
heard him.</p>

<p>“No, no!” she protested, rising to her feet. “Let me
stay; I will be brave, Cousin Sholto. You will let me
stay—you must let me stay! I cannot go!”</p>

<p>“Dr. Godfrey will let you remain if you have the
strength,” the squire said, soothingly. Then he took her
two cold hands in his and drew her to the wide window,
while the doctor motioned the men away and closed the
door.</p>

<p>Margery’s eyes never left the pallid face of her husband.
In breathless, sickening anxiety she watched Dr.
Godfrey pass his hand over the injured man’s chest and
fractured arm, unconscious that the broken respirations
that came from her lips told of the agony she was enduring.
The doctor looked around as the sound fell on his
ears, and in an instant he knew how to act.</p>

<p>“Lady Court, I want you to help me,” he said, gravely,
advancing to her. “Go at once, and fetch me brandy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
some warm water, a sponge and some old linen—as
quickly as possible, please.”</p>

<p>In a moment she had turned and left the room. The
squire glanced at the doctor.</p>

<p>“It was to get her away,” explained the medical man.
“The case is hopeless; I can do nothing. The ribs are
terribly crushed, the lungs and heart vitally injured, and
there is a severe fracture of the left shoulder and arm.
It is only a question of hours now—perhaps minutes; but
it will do her good to give her occupation. That tension
of her nerves was killing her, poor young creature!”</p>

<p>“I can do no good?” queried the squire, passing a
trembling hand across his brow.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Dr. Godfrey. “Let me advise you to
go to your room. When the change comes you shall
know.”</p>

<p>The squire went away, feeling now more than ever that
he was indeed a weak old man. The doctor was alone
and bending over the patient when Margery came back,
carrying all that he had asked for. She stood as silent
as a statue while he slowly poured a few drops of brandy
between the closed lips; then, as a sign of life came once
more into the deathlike face, she gave a sob of thankfulness
and sunk upon her knees by the couch.</p>

<p>The earl’s eyelids were raised with difficulty, and his
dark eyes wandered around slowly till they rested on his
wife’s face; then the faintest of smiles broke over his
countenance, dying away the next instant in a contraction
of pain.</p>

<p>“Nugent, Nugent—oh, speak to me!” whispered Margery,
wildly, putting her trembling lips to his passive
hand, all the goodness, the generosity, the tenderness that
this man had lavished upon her coming back to her
memory and maddening her.</p>

<p>Dr. Godfrey moistened the earl’s lips again; the breath
came from the injured chest in short, broken respirations;
and then, as dew to a parched flower, as golden light in
direst darkness, fell the whisper of her hubsand’s voice on
Margery’s ears. He looked at the doctor, then said, with
difficulty:</p>

<p>“Leave us—alone.”</p>

<p>Dr. Godfrey rose and turned to Margery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Do not agitate him,” he said, gently. “He has something
to tell you, I see. Moisten his lips with brandy if
he grows faint. I will go out on the terrace; I shall be
close at hand if you want me.”</p>

<p>The earl’s eyes followed him; then they came back to
Margery. He tried to raise his hand to her head, but
the effort was too much; it fell, nerveless, to his side.</p>

<p>“My darling—my wife! You are sorry, then?” he
gasped.</p>

<p>“Sorry?” whispered Margery, her voice thick with agony.
“Oh, that I could give my life for yours, Nugent!
That I could spare you all!” She could say no more.</p>

<p>The earl moved his head a little; his eyes closed. She
put the brandy to his lips.</p>

<p>“It has come at last!” he murmured. “Margery, listen,
my darling! I know your secret, your love story.” He
wrestled for a moment with his growing faintness; then
went on, brokenly: “I was in my room that day when
you parted from Stuart, and I heard all, my brave darling—learned
how much you were suffering. My death
will set you free. You will be happy in the future, Margery,
my sweet one!”</p>

<p>“Do not—oh, do not speak like that, Nugent!” she
whispered, mad with a fever of pain, regret, remorse.
“You torture me!”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you how happy you have made me, wife.
Death is near—you must——” His voice sank; then,
with a last effort, he went on: “Promise to make
Stuart happy. He loves you, Margery. Give me your
promise——”</p>

<p>“I cannot!” she broke in, in tearless agony. “Nugent,
you break my heart—you——” Then seeing the intense
eagerness of his dark eyes, she paused.</p>

<p>“Promise!” his lips formed rather than spoke.</p>

<p>She hesitated only for a moment.</p>

<p>“I promise,” she murmured, faintly.</p>

<p>A smile lighted up his face.</p>

<p>“Now all is ended!” The words came very faintly.
“I am content. Kiss me, my——”</p>

<p>Margery put her lips to his—their coldness filled her
with dread. A sigh came from the earl’s injured breast,
his eyes closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“Nugent, I promise!” she murmured, wildly. “But
you will not go—you will not leave me! I want you!
You must stay! Nugent, open your eyes—speak to me—husband!”</p>

<p>She bent over him again, and as she did so a gentle
hand was placed on her shoulder, and she was raised from
her knees. She saw the still, pallid face, calm and passive
in the sunlight; then a great blackness came over her, and
she knew no more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>


<p>“Margery, the sea is beautiful to-day. Come out, child;
it will do you good.”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson spoke in her old abrupt, almost stern way;
but she experienced deep, heartfelt pain as she looked at
the slight form in its heavy mourning-robe, and at the
girlish, beautiful face beneath the widow’s cap.</p>

<p>Margery raised her eyes from her writing.</p>

<p>“I do not care for it, dear,” she answered, gently; “and
I must finish these letters for the post. Remember, Wavemouth
is not London; we do not go by steam down
here.”</p>

<p>“Your letters can wait,” said Miss Lawson. “They
are not of such consequence as your health.”</p>

<p>“My tenants at Beecham do not say that,” returned
Lady Court, with a faint smile; “but, if you wish it
very——”</p>

<p>“I do wish it very much; indeed, I am rather dull, Margery.”</p>

<p>The well-assumed plaintiveness of the elder woman’s
last words was most successful.</p>

<p>“Dull!” repeated Margery, putting down her pen at
once. “Oh, forgive me! How selfish I am, dear friend!”</p>

<p>“There, don’t waste time in self-reproach! Go and put
on your hat—not your heavy bonnet. The fresh air will
do you more good than sentimentalizing.”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson brushed away a tear as the slender figure
left the room. A year had gone—a sharp and trying
spring, a summer of golden splendor, an autumn of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
cheerless misery, a winter of frost and chill, and spring
was come again; and during all that time Margery had
lived weighted down by a burden of anguish and sorrow.
Miss Lawson had gone to her at the beginning of her
grief, and, discarding all other ties, had given herself
up to her old pupil, who clung to her so despairingly;
and it was the elder woman’s one aim to drive the gloom
and despondency from the girlish brow, and bring joy
and happiness back to the youthful heart.</p>

<p>She knew Margery’s secret now. Stuart and she were
leagued together; but all through the year, though she
had tried again and again, she could not bring the lovers
and cousins together. Margery shrunk from meeting
Stuart—shrunk with a heart full of remorse, pain
and morbid gloom. Was it right that she should be
glad, have happiness, when one who had loved her so
truly and tenderly lay in the grave forgotten? Once,
only once, had she spoken on this subject to Miss Lawson;
and, like a wise woman, the governess said nothing,
but decided to wait.</p>

<p>“It is but natural, after all. Margery’s sensitive, generous
spirit has received so terrible a shock that it has
shattered all joy in life at one blow.”</p>

<p>So spoke Miss Lawson as she reasoned with Stuart,
who hungered for a kind word, a sign, from his early
love. He honored her for her fealty to the dead, but he
was human, and his heart cried out for peace after so
much misery. He had been more than touched by the
noble, generous thoughtfulness of the dying man; for,
after all was over and the will read, a letter was sent
him, and, alone in his chamber, Stuart learned the wish
and desire of Nugent, Earl of Court.</p>

<p>The writer told how, on returning earlier than he had
anticipated, he had entered the house through the window
of his “den” from the grounds. This was barred
after him by his servant; and thus he became an unintentional
eavesdropper to the sad meeting between his wife
and her cousin; and he ended by entreating Stuart to let
no obstacle stand in his path, but to consummate Margery’s
and his own happiness by a speedy marriage.</p>

<p>With the letter of the dead man close to his heart, Stuart
buried all compunction and regret, and waited and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
longed for Margery to speak; but she was silent. She
was racked by conflicting emotions. Day and night the
image of her dead husband hardly left her mind; for
evidence of his great love still surrounded her, Court
Manor being her own house, bequeathed to her when
the rest of the estate passed to the next heir. She could
not banish the regret and remorse that had seized her.
Again and again she longed for the past to return, so
that she might act differently. And yet her love for
Stuart had not grown less; he was still her hero, her
king. It was doubt, and nervous, sensitive pain that
kept her from him; and day by day the pain grew
greater, till she knew not what to do.</p>

<p>Had she been allowed, Margery would have remained
at Court Manor, in spite of the sad memories that clung
to it; but Miss Lawson took care not to sanction such an
arrangement. She dictated to the young Countess of
Court as she had dictated in the old days to Margery
Daw; and unconsciously the girlish widow obeyed, as
she had always done, and allowed her friend to rule.
They had spent the first six months following the earl’s
death at Beecham Park; then Miss Lawson took Margery
abroad before paying a brief visit to the manor.
Now she accompanied Lady Court to Wavemouth, at
Margery’s own request. Personally, she thought the little
village too quiet for the girl, but Margery seemed to
like its peaceful monotony, so she raised no objection.
As time went on, however, and she found the sad apathy
increase, instead of decrease, the governess began to
consider how she ought to act.</p>

<p>Stuart had not been mentioned between them for
weeks, though Miss Lawson had to send a daily report
to the eager, anxious man. Something must be done,
she declared, mentally, as she turned to meet Margery
entering the room in her heavy black robe and large
black hat, to banish the morbid remorse and sadness that
were preying upon the life of the young girl.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you are sensible,” she observed, nodding
at sight of the hat. “Now come along; it is a
beautiful afternoon.”</p>

<p>Margery smiled faintly at the sharp words yet gentle
voice, and together they left the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>They walked on in silence to the very edge of the sea,
and stood watching the sunlit-crested waves come rolling
in. Margery was deep in thought, and Miss Lawson
watched her anxiously. Her heart prompted her to
speak out, to urge the girl to cast off her burden of
gloom and turn once more to joy and happiness, but the
sad young face looking across the sea stopped her.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun descended lower and lower, and still
Margery stood gazing at the sea.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“The great sea, faultless as a flow’r,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Throbs trembling under beam and breeze</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And laughs with love of th’ am’rous hour.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At last, as a gray cloud obscured the golden light for
a time, she turned to Miss Lawson.</p>

<p>“Let us go back,” she said, hurriedly, with a little
shudder. “I am tired now.”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson walked with her in silence.</p>

<p>“I am an old woman,” she mused to herself, “this is
beyond me. We have waited long and wearily, and yet
she gets no better. I shall give in, and leave the rest to
Stuart.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A message sped swiftly from the fishing village to the
great city. It was short, yet it brought a thrill of intense
joy to Stuart Crosbie’s aching heart. There was
no hope breathed in the words, but hope lived within
his breast, as it had lived through all his weary waiting.
He longed impatiently for the night to be gone—for
the morning to come, and when the sun rose over the
still sleeping city, he was speeding away from it to the
sea.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Where shall we land you, sweet?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">On fields of strange men’s feet,</div>
<div class="verse indent5">Or fields near home,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Or where the fire-flow’rs blow,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Or where the flow’rs of snow,</div>
<div class="verse indent5">Or flow’rs of foam?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">We are in love’s hand to-day.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So sang his heart in glad anticipation of its joy. Happiness
had been so long absent, it must come now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
Misery, despair, sorrow, were all forgotten—he lived
again!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“You will be back to-night?” asked Margery, as she
put a waterproof round Miss Lawson’s form. “You
promise me?”</p>

<p>“I promise,” said Miss Lawson, briskly. “Ugh, what
a day! Margery, take my advice; don’t go out.”</p>

<p>“It will not hurt me; I like the wind and the spray.”</p>

<p>“Then wrap up well. Pauline”—turning to the maid—“if
her ladyship does go out, see that she puts on something
sensible.”</p>

<p>“How little you trust me!” said Margery, with a faint
smile. “But are you sensibly clad, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Two shawls, a waterproof, goloshes, and an umbrella,”
observed Miss Lawson, quietly. Inwardly she
felt a thrill of satisfaction; Margery seemed brighter,
more natural, more her old self to-day.</p>

<p>“Then good-by, dear.” Margery put her lips to the
elder woman’s. “Give my love to Mrs. Fothergill and
the doctor.”</p>

<p>Miss Lawson nodded and walked away.</p>

<p>“I am an old fool,” she declared, savagely, to herself,
as she felt a tear roll down her cheek, “and I only hope
I shall keep out of the way for some good!”</p>

<p>Left alone, Margery stood for a while at the window,
gazing at the rough, angry sea; then she asked Pauline
for her cloak and hat.</p>

<p>“Will miladi that I go with her?” asked the maid, in
her broken English.</p>

<p>Margery shook her head.</p>

<p>“I shall not go far; and this wind does you no good,
Pauline.”</p>

<p>“Miladi is so kind. If she will permit, I think that
hat will not be wise. See this <i>capuchon</i>—so warm! It
will be best.”</p>

<p>Margery agreed, and tied the comfortable hood round
her delicate, lovely face, looking sweetly fair with her
halo of red-gold curls and her deep, lustrous blue eyes.
She turned toward the shore; the roaring and dashing
of the sea exhilarated her, the strong, soft wind seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
to blow away the clouds of doubt and pain that hung
over her. Her sorrow was lost in the pleasurable excitement
that thrilled her as she stood, wind-blown and
rain-drenched, and watched the great waves come rolling
in, with their thunderous voices and mountains of spray.
The tempest seemed to suit her humor; she reveled in
the freedom and wildness of the elements as in the birth
of a new life—a life with hope springing glorious within.</p>

<p>She moved on as quickly as the wind would allow,
stopping every now and then to gather her cloak closer
around her. The gale had blown her curls in rough
fashion all over her hood; there was a light in her eyes,
a glow of color on her fair cheeks; for the moment she
looked the Margery of old, not the sad girl-widow of
present days.</p>

<p>Few of the fisher-folk were about; but in the distance
she could see some children running to and fro on the
shore, and the wind now and then wafted their voices
to her ears. Tired at last, her breath almost spent, she
turned inland in a cross direction, determining to rest
at one of the cottages before going home. The wind
blew her along at times, almost taking her off her feet;
and she had to drop upon the wet beach more than once
to gather strength. At last she sighted the cottages,
and struggled to the first one. The women knew her
well; she was a great favorite, and they were never tired
of dwelling on her youth, beauty, sad history, and goodness
and generosity.</p>

<p>She knocked at the rough door, and it was opened
immediately.</p>

<p>“May I come in and rest, Mrs. David?” she asked,
leaning back against the doorpost, almost breathless.</p>

<p>“Lor’ bless me, my lady, in course! Come in at once!”
exclaimed the buxom fisherwoman. “It is a sight too
wild for you to be out. It is rough here, too, my lady.
The chair is hard; but——”</p>

<p>“It is most acceptable,” sighed Margery, sinking, with
a sigh of fatigue, into the great wooden chair. “I have
been walking along the shore. How rough the sea is
to-day! And how have you been, Mrs. David? You
look sad—are you in trouble? Oh”—catching sight of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
small form covered with blankets lying in a warm corner
by the fire—“your child is ill?”</p>

<p>Mrs. David put her apron to her eyes.</p>

<p>“He is better now, my lady,” she replied, with a sob
in her voice; “but he was all but gone this morning. Oh,
dear me, it fair broke my heart to see him—him, my only
one, my lady!”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Margery, quickly, her heart
full of sympathy. She knew the child well—a beautiful,
rosy-cheeked boy, the very light and joy of his parents’
life. “Is he very ill?”</p>

<p>“He went out the morning, your ladyship. My mind
misgive me as I saw him go; but he loves the sea. My
man is away over to the town to-day; and Jim he begged
to go out and watch the waves; and he went too near,
my lady, and got drawed in by the tide, and would have
been washed away if a strange gentleman—Heaven
bless him!—hadn’t tore off his coat and plunged in. I
thought my Jim was dead when I see him carried in
white and all dripping; but the gentleman he rubbed him,
and rolled him in blankets. And now he’s sleeping like
a lamb, you see, my lady. But; oh, I nearly died!”</p>

<p>“It was dreadful!” said Margery, gently, rising and
putting her soft, white hand on the rough, tanned arm
of the mother. “But don’t cry, Mrs. David. Jim is all
right now, poor little fellow. You are nervous and upset.
Can you send up to my house this evening? I will
have some nice things put together for him that will
soon make him well.”</p>

<p>“Heaven bless you for your goodness, my lady!” returned
Mrs. David. “I ain’t one to give way to tears
often; but you can understand——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand,” whispered Margery, standing and
looking down at the sleeping child, while Mrs. David
went on with her account of the accident.</p>

<p>“It were just the merest chance the gentleman were
on the spot,” she said. “He’d come from the town, and
was walking to Wavemouth, along the shore, when he
saw little Jim washed off his feet, and he was in the
water in an instant.”</p>

<p>“He was brave!” Margery interjected, quietly.</p>

<p>“Ay, that he was; and it’ll never be forgotten by us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
though we live to hundreds! But won’t you sit down,
my lady? I expects the gentleman here every minute
to inquire after Jim.”</p>

<p>“I am rested now, and I think I will make a start.”</p>

<p>Margery walked to the little window and looked out.
The wind was raging just as fiercely as ever, and the rain
was beating furiously against the panes.</p>

<p>“Let me give you some tea, my lady,” urged Mrs.
David. “I’ll have it ready in an instant.”</p>

<p>Margery shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mrs. David; I must be gone. I
will——”</p>

<p>A sharp knock came at the door, and for some strange
reason she moved round so that nothing could be seen
but her back, draped in the hood and cloak, while Mrs.
David bustled to the door.</p>

<p>“It is you, sir! Come in and welcome! He’s sleeping
sound now, sir. Ah, Heaven give you happiness, as
you have given it to me to-day!”</p>

<p>A curious sensation stole over Margery’s heart—a
sensation that brought a vague touch of joy. The next
moment the joy increased, for a voice spoke, the tones
of which recalled all the golden dream of her early
love.</p>

<p>It was Stuart, her lover! Her hands, clasped together,
were clasped against her throbbing heart, her lips murmured
his name silently; but still she stood motionless;
and Stuart’s eye went from the unknown woman in the
hood and cloak to the child.</p>

<p>“He’s all right now, Mrs. David; there is no fever.
You will have him as jolly as ever in a day or two.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, sir! And you yourself, sir—you ain’t
got no harm?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” laughed Stuart, cheerily. “Sea water
does not hurt me; I am used to it. I have been in a gale
or two at sea, you know. It is rough weather, though,
to-day, Mrs. David.”</p>

<p>“That it is, sir. Here’s her ladyship, sir, quite done
up by the wind. She’s honored me with resting a while.”</p>

<p>Stuart stared. How blind he had been! How could
he have overlooked that slender figure? His heart
burned within his breast, he could hardly restrain his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
joy. And Margery? In a moment her doubts, her sad
misgivings vanished; she knew that her love lived again
in all its strength and sweetness. It had been clouded,
not overcome. She moved from the window and put
out her hand.</p>

<p>“I know this gentleman, Mrs. David,” she said, steadily,
though her limbs were trembling. “He is my cousin.”</p>

<p>“Your ladyship’s cousin?” exclaimed the woman, in
surprise. “Oh, sir, that brings you closer to my heart!
I’ve told my lady all about it.”</p>

<p>“How brave you were!” murmured Margery, as she
drew her hand from Stuart’s firm clasp.</p>

<p>“Brave! I did nothing. But, come, cousin—you ought
to be going. Shall I see you home? Will you let me?”</p>

<p>“If you please.”</p>

<p>Margery bent and kissed the child softly, then put out
her hand to Mrs. David.</p>

<p>“I will come to-morrow and see how he is. Don’t forget
to send to-night.”</p>

<p>“I will not, thank you again and again, my lady!”</p>

<p>Margery smiled, and walked to the door. The small,
homely room seemed suddenly illumined by a strange,
mysterious light, golden and strong as the sun. Stuart
drew the door after them, then put out his hand without
a word, and Margery placed her own in his.</p>

<p>He led her from the cottage to a sheltered spot, and
then stood looking down at her with eyes that shone like
stars in the passion of his love.</p>

<p>“Margery,” he said, quietly, “I have come to you.
Have you no word of hope for me?”</p>

<p>She stood silent for an instant, then raised her lovelit
eyes to his.</p>

<p>“One word,” she whispered—“stay!”</p>

<p>“My darling, my own, my own forever, it has come
at last!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The
fact that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely
due to the work of a specialist. The man who wrote
these stories produced no other type of fiction. His mind was
concentrated upon the creation of new plots and situations in
which his hero emerged triumphantly from all sorts of trouble,
and landed the criminal just where he should be—behind the
bars.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected.</p>

<p>Table of contents has been added and placed into the public domain by
the transcriber.</p>

<p>The first word on page 97 (before “Margery” in the sentence “but,
Margery, I am not sane, now!”) is illegible and has been omitted.</p>

<p>The word “gnawing” at the end of page 216 is a best guess; the source
text is nearly illegible.</p>

<p>Some inconsistent hyphenation has been retained from the original.
